    "instructions": "For Pie Dough:\nCombine flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt and sugar. Using the paddle of an electric mixer or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter and shortening until mixture resembles \"small peas.\" Pour the vanilla extract over the dough. Pour ice water, a little at a time, over the dough, and mix lightly until the dough comes together. Separate dough into 2 pieces and flatten each piece like a pancake. Wrap each piece of dough separately in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours.\nFor Pie Filling:\nCombine rhubarb and strawberries in a big bowl. Combine sugar, flour and scraped vanilla bean seeds and mix in with fruit mixture. Let sit while rolling pie dough.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch glass pie plate. Roll 1/2 pie dough to approximately 1/8-inch thick and about 1 inch larger than the pie plate. Fit in into the pie pan leaving the overlap intact. Fill with fruit filling and dot top with 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. Brush beaten egg with pastry brush around the rim of the pie. Roll out the remaining dough and make a lattice top. Crimp the edges. Brush lattice with beaten egg. Do not brush the edge of the pie--this will cause the dough to become too dark while baking. Generously sprinkle with crystal sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 350 degrees F and bake for an additional hour. Pie is done when golden brown and juices bubbling from pie appear thickened.",

    "instructions": "Cut the tubes into rings. Lightly coat the squid with flour and fry 360 degree F oil until golden brown. We make this pizza the same way as the margarita except that the spicy oil is drizzled on instead of just olive oil and then the calamari is placed on top, and garnished with scallions.\nPrepare a hot charcoal fire, setting the grill rack 3 to 4 inches above the coals.\nOn a large, oiled, inverted baking sheet, spread and flatten the pizza dough with your hands into a 10 to 12-inch free-form circle, 1/8-inch thick. Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.\nWhen the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.\nUsing tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nSlide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.\nPizza Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.\nCombine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to very low, and gently simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the flavors continue to infuse the oil as it cools\nStrain the oil into a clean jar. When it has cooled to room temperature, cover and refrigerate.",

Cover and let stand 2 hours. Position a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the lowest oven rack; preheat to 500 degrees F for at least 30 minutes. Stretch each ball of dough into a 12-to-14-inch round on individual sheets of parchment paper. Let rest 15 minutes. Remove and discard the garlic from the sauce. Spread a thin layer of sauce on each pizza, leaving a border. Top with one-quarter each of the mozzarella, parmesan, cherry peppers, soppressata and radicchio; drizzle with olive oil. Slide 1 pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone in the oven. Bake until the crust browns, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with oregano.

    "instructions": "For the cupcakes: Preheat the convection oven to 325 degrees F or a standard oven to 350 degrees F.\nIn large mixer bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and butter until light and fluffy with a heavy duty mixer. Add the eggs, one at a time, and mix thoroughly after each addition. Add the coconut extract and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt. Add half of the flour to the mixer bowl along with 1/2 cup of the half-and-half. Mix until the flour is mixed in, scraping the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Add the rest of flour mixture and the other 1/2 cup half-and-half. Mix until the batter is smooth and all of the flour lumps are gone. Fold in the coconut flakes.\nFill 24 cupcake liners half full and bake for 20 minutes in the convection oven or 28 minutes in the standard oven. The tops of the cupcakes should be lightly browned. Check the cupcakes to make sure no batter sticks to a wooden toothpick when inserted into the cupcake. Cool the cupcakes completely.\nFor the mousse filling: In large mixer bowl, beat the heavy cream, half-and-half, coconut extract and pudding mix until light and fluffy using a heavy duty mixer. It should have the consistency of whipped cream. Gently fold in the coconut using a plastic spatula. Put the filling in a pastry bag or zipper bag with a corner cut off.\nFor the coconut buttercream: In large mixer bowl, beat together the butter and half of the powdered sugar using heavy duty mixer. Add the half-and-half and the rest of the powdered sugar, along with the coconut extract, and mix well. If the frosting is thicker than you would like, add 1 teaspoon of additional half-and-half at a time, mixing well after each addition, until the frosting reaches the correct consistency. The thickness may depend on the humidity levels in your region. Put into a pastry bag.\nTo assemble: Make a hole in the middle of each cupcake using a sharp knife. Be sure and leave a small amount of cake in the bottom of the hole. Fill the cupcakes with the mousse filling. Frost with coconut buttercream.

    "instructions": "Preheat oven to 425 degree F.\nHave your butcher tie the pork roast into the traditional crown roast shape, chine bone removed, split between the ribs to facilitate the formation of the crown shape. Ask for the chine bone which will be used to roast the meat on to avoid burning the bottom. In a saucepan over medium heat combine the pureed Ancho chili, tomato puree, honey, vinegar, Worcestershire, black pepper, ground cumin and garlic. Bring the ingredients to a simmer and allow to cook for 20 minutes before removing from the heat and adding the bourbon.\nSeason the roast with salt and pepper and brush with Ancho marinade. Place the chine bone in a roasting pan and place the pork roast on the bones: this will prevent the bottom of the roast from burning. Place the roasting pan into the oven and cook for 20 minutes before turning the heat down to 350 degrees F. Brush the roast at frequent intervals during the cooking process to keep the roast moist as well as perfumed with the spice mixture. Add the roughly cut vegetables and continue to cook until the roast reaches an internal temperature of 150 degrees F. Remove the roast from the pan and allow to stand for 20 minutes before carving. While the roast is resting make the quick pan gravy by pouring off all of the rendered pork fat, leaving the rough cut vegetables in the pan. Place the roasting pan on the stove top, turn the burner on underneath the roasting pan and continue to cook the vegetables with the chine bone. Carefully deglaze the pan by adding the wine allowing most of the liquid to cook off before adding the hot chicken broth, reducing the heat to a simmer.

    "instructions": "In the top half of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stir the chocolate until melted. Using a pastry brush, brush the baked pie shell up to the rim with the melted chocolate. Set aside to cool and harden at room temperature or, uncovered, in the refrigerator. In a large saucepan, bring the milk, cream of coconut, and vanilla bean to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg yolks and sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture.\nStrain the mixture back into the saucepan to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the butter. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest the bowl containing the custard in the ice water and let cool, stirring frequently to cool the mixture. When the custard is cool, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream and coconut into the custard. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-coated pie shell and smooth the top. Refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours. (Or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.) Serve cold.\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.\nTurn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in 1/2, and shape into 2 round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won't be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It's entirely up to you.\nSprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don't worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don't do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\nSet your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it's up to you. Either choice will work.\nTo transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\nDon't stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don't be concerned; we'll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.\nWorking around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill 20 minutes before baking.\nHeat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don't turn down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. (Pie weights are reusable metal or ceramic pellets that hold the crust in place as it bakes. You can buy them at cooking supply stores.) Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.",

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nPreheat your oven to 400 degrees F.\nMeanwhile, gather the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar and baking soda into your large mixing bowl and whisk together until fully incorporated. Now cut your butter into small cubes with your bench knife or straight edge knife and place into the bowl. Using your pastry cutter, cut the butter into the dry mixture in a downward twisting motion until you reach a sandy texture. At this point, your dry mix should feel like beach sand, but if there are some slightly larger pieces of butter remaining this is okay. Those pieces will create the flaky effect when the biscuits begin to cook. Now, create a well in the center of your bowl of dry ingredients. Pour the buttermilk into the center of the bowl. Using your hands (this will feel funny and get messy), incorporate all the ingredients until the dough begins to come together and become one.\nNow put a small amount of flour on a flat surface and continue to bring the dough together, making sure not to knead the dough or overwork it. Use some of that extra flour to bring it all together and get the dough off your fingers too. Now spread out and flatten the dough so it's about the height of your flattened hand. Using your biscuit cutter (dip it in some flour to keep any dough from sticking to it), cut out 24 biscuits, reworking the dough if need be. Place a piece of parchment paper on your cookie sheet and line up the cut biscuits, 4 by 6. Place the biscuits into the oven and cook until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

In a large heavy-bottomed high-sided saute pan, fry the chorizo in the oil until it is grainy but still soft, about 4 minutes, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon to break up the meat and prevent a crust from forming on the bottom of the pan.

There should be a nice mix of very soft and still slightly crunchy chips when the chiliqueles are finished. Remove from the heat and use a slotted spoon or tongs to heap generous portions into each of 4 bowls. While still piping hot, top with the grated Cheddar and Montery Jack cheeses, chorizo, a dollop of sour cream, and a sprinkling of red onion and cilantro. Serve hot with Guacamole on the side.\nIn a medium stock pot, place the tomatoes, onion, jalapeno, and garlic and cover with 2 quarts water. Bring to a boil over high heat and let cook 5 to 8 minutes, until the vegetables are very soft. Transfer with a slotted spoon to a blender and puree until smooth with the cilantro and salt.

Check seasoning and add additional salt, if necessary, and pepper, to taste.\nIn a large high-sided saute pan over medium heat, bring the oil to 350 degrees F. Fry the chips in small batches until crisp and lightly golden, about 2 to 3 minutes. (They will continue to darken while resting.)

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nMake the eggs: In a large nonstick pan or two medium nonstick pans, add the butter (do the division if using 2 pans). Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted, tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later).\nOk, pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you'll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg, go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl, leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and, using the edge of the shell, gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not, how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!!\nCook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes, so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps, just remove the pan(s) from the heat.\nCook the refried beans: In a medium pot, add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat, using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered, add the onions, a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook, stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo, add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit, add a splash of water or, if you are feeling slightly dangerous, add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm.\nChar the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron, please) or griddle over high heat, add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred, it moves to the top of the stack, flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate!\nBuild your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don't mess with the yolks. Season each yolk with salt and a crack of black pepper. Sprinkle the entire plate with cilantro and spritz with lime juice and a shake of hot sauce. Serve each plate with 2 folded charred tortillas.",

    "instructions": "Heat the heavy cream in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan until bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan. Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.\nIf the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set.\nWhen the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache.",

    "instructions": "To make the dough by hand: Whisk together the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. Using your fingers, work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture.\nTo make the dough in a food processor: Pulse the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor fitted with the metal blade until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow cornmeal mixed with bean-size bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don't let the dough form into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry, add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade and bring the dough together by hand.\nForm the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 hour.\nFor the filling: Put the lemon juice in a medium bowl. Peel, halve and core the apples. Cut each half into 4 wedges. Toss the apples with the lemon juice. Add the sugar and toss to combine evenly.\nMelt the butter over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add the apples and cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture begins to simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the apples soften and release most of their juices, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the blackberries and gently stir until they just start to break down, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle the flour, cinnamon and nutmeg over the fruit and gently stir until the liquid thickens, about 1 minute. Transfer to a bowl to cool completely. (This filling can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated.)\nCut the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll each half into a disc 11 to 12 inches wide. Layer the dough between pieces of parchment or wax paper on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.\nPlace a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nLine the bottom of a 9-inch pie pan with one of the discs of dough, and trim it so it lays about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pan. Evenly layer the apple-berry filling in the pan.\nUse a chef's knife or a pizza cutter and cut the second round into 1/2-inch thick strips. Lay strips of dough, evenly spaced, across the entire pie. Weave more strips of dough perpendicular through the previous strips to make a lattice or basket weave design across the entire pie. Trim the excess ends from the strips of dough. Pinch the bottom crust edge and lattice edge together, and flute the edge as desired. Brush the surface of the dough with egg and then sprinkle with sugar. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nBake the pie on the preheated baking sheet until the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 3 hours before serving.

    "instructions": "Special equipment: Parchment paper, ruler, scissors, rolling pin, pizza cutter, cookie cutters, disposable pastry bags, small and medium decorating tips\nFor the dough: Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Mix the eggs and vanilla with a fork in a small bowl.\nBeat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners' sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium, and beat until slightly creamy, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer), stopping halfway through to scrape the bowl.\nReduce the speed to low, slowly add in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time, in 3 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters (if using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning). Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer), and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer).\nTurn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide the dough into 3 even pieces, each about 13 ounces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.\nWhile the dough chills, cut templates for the house from paper:\n1 base, 8 by 8 inches\n1 roof, 5 3/4 by 6 1/2 inches\n2 slanted side walls, both 5 inches wide, one 4 inches high on the left and\n3 inches high on the right, the other 3 inches high on the left and 4 inches high on the right, with optional windows cut out\n1 front wall, 5 inches wide by 4 inches high, with a door cut out\n1 back wall, 5 by 3 inches\nTo roll, cut and bake the cookies and house: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (have extra parchment on hand). Take 2 of the dough pieces out of the refrigerator, and let them soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes.\nDust a piece of parchment with flour. Dust one square of dough with flour, and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick (no thicker) and 9 to 10 inches square. Lift the dough occasionally to make sure it isn't sticking to the parchment. Cut out cookies with cutters; transfer to a prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Freeze while you cut the rest of the dough. Reserve the scraps for the house pieces. Take the last piece of dough from the refrigerator to soften.\nDust the parchment and the second piece of dough with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick and 9 to 10 inches square. Lay the base template on top, and use a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife to cut out the base. Peel off the scraps from the sides and reserve. Pick up the parchment with the base on it, put it on an unlined baking sheet and freeze while you finish cutting the other house pieces.\nDust a third piece of parchment and the third piece of softened dough with flour. Roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thick and 11 by 7 inches. Put the roof and the front wall templates on top, and use the pizza cutter to cut the pieces. Transfer the pieces to the last prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out a door from the front wall. Combine the scrap pieces with the reserved scraps, and gently knead together on the parchment; flour, roll to 1/4 inch thick and about 8 by 9 inches and cut out the remaining walls. Transfer the pieces to the baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out windows from the walls. Freeze for 10 minutes before baking.\nBake the house pieces until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans front to back and bottom to top halfway through the baking time. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes.\nWhile the house pieces cool, dust the cookies with sanding sugar if using, and bake until very light golden brown, about 16 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to completely, about 30 minutes.\nTo assemble the house: Put 1/3 cup royal icing in a pastry bag fitted with the larger pastry tip. Place the roof browned-side up on a work surface with one of the short sides facing you. Pipe a thick 5-inch line of frosting along the short side 1 inch in from the edge. Let the icing harden while you build the rest of the house. (This will prevent the roof of the house from sliding off.)\nPut the base on a large platter or board on which it will be displayed. Next, assemble the house using the royal icing as glue and making sure to turn the walls lighter-sides out: Hold up one of the side walls and pipe a line of icing along the bottom and up both sides. Set it down while you hold up the back wall and pipe a line of icing along its bottom edge. Stick these two pieces together on the base with the icing, pressing them gently together so they adhere. Hold the pieces for a few seconds, until they can stand on their own. Repeat with the other side wall and the front wall, pressing all four walls together.\nReserve the royal icing in the pastry bag. Whisk water about 1 teaspoon at a time into the rest of the icing to thin it slightly to the consistency of molasses. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with the smaller pastry tip.\nTo decorate the house: Decorate the walls as desired: Use the thin icing for piping lines and decorations and for decorating the cookies. Use the thick icing to glue heavy pieces of candy to the sides and roof of the house. To make a grassy yard, spread a thin layer of icing with a butter knife around the base of the house. Press some of the coconut grass into the icing. Put some coconut grass inside the house (you don't need to ice inside). Decorate the yard as desired. Fill the house with candy and cookies (make sure the icing has set).\nSet the roof on top, lighter-side up (don't attach it), and decorate as desired.\nCombine 2 cups of the confectioners' sugar and the meringue powder with a fork in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. (Alternatively, use a hand mixer and medium bowl.) Add 3 tablespoons of water, and mix on low speed until smooth and thick, with a consistency like caulk. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 3 minutes.) If the icing seems a bit loose, mix in a tablespoon of confectioners' sugar at a time until thickened. Transfer to a clean bowl, and lay a damp piece of paper towel on top. Cover tightly until ready to use.\nToss half the coconut and 3 drops food coloring with a fork in a medium bowl until the coconut is uniformly green. Add the remaining coconut, and toss gently to combine. Cover tightly and set aside.",

    "instructions": "Combine the rosemary, sage, garlic, and salt and pepper in a small bowl and rub it all over the pork. Place the pork on a large plate, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for a few hours.\nPlace a medium heavy pan that will hold the roast somewhat snugly over medium heat and add the butter and oil. When the butter begins to foam, add the pork and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly golden on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. (Keep your eyes on the butter so it doesn't burn and reduce the heat a bit if needed.)\nAdd 1 cup of the milk and stir to loosen the browned bits attached to the bottom of the pan. As soon as the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, partially cover the pan, and simmer until almost all the milk has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Add 1 more cup milk and continue cooking, basting and turning the meat a few times, until most of the milk has evaporated. Cook the pork in this manner, adding the milk 1/2 to 1 cup at a time, until it reads 160 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 2 hours. (The pork can be cooked up to this point 1 hour or so ahead. In that case, cook only until it reaches 155 degrees F, because it will keep on cooking as it sits in the hot pan juices.)\nRemove the lid and raise the heat to high. If no more milk is left in the pan, add 1/2 cup or so more. Cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pan to release the browned bits and turning the pork once or twice, until most of the milk has evaporated and the meat has a rich, golden brown color. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and let it rest for about 10 minutes while you finish the sauce.\nSpoon off some of the fat from the pan. Add 1/3 cup water and stir quickly, over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the pan until only the brown glazed clusters of milk particles remain.\nCut the meat into 1/2-inch thick slices and serve topped with a bit of the pan juices.\nNote: Pork loin is generally prepared with two center-cut loins tied together, thus making them \"double loin roasts.\" If one loin roast is used instead of the double, the cooking time will obviously be reduced by about half.\nSince the pork loin is a lean piece of meat, make sure not to trim away the fat attached to it, because it will add additional flavor.",

Reserve.\nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees F.\nHeat the oil in a large cast iron pan, over medium-high heat. Season the meat all over with salt and pepper. Brown the veal on all sides, about 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and roast until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 130 degrees F(the loin will be pink at the center), about 20 minutes. Allow the meat to rest in a warm place for 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhile the veal is roasting, blanch the asparagus in boiling salted water. Refresh it in ice water, then drain and set aside. Just before serving, melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the asparagus, season with salt and pepper and cook just until heated through and tender, about 5 minutes.\nTo serve, thinly slice the veal. Place a spoonful of Roasted Potatoes with Wild Ramps in the center of each plate. Arrange 2 or 3 slices of veal over the potatoes. Place asparagus around the potatoes, spoon sauce over the meat and serve.\nIf using fresh mushrooms clean them by rubbing them with a damp cloth, or briefly submerging them in water, then drain and blot dry. If using dried mushrooms, place them in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Set the mushrooms aside until soft, then drain. Chop the fresh or re-hydrated dry mushrooms.\nHeat the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the shallots and chopped mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are almost tender, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes more. Add the wine, bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the mushrooms are fully soft, about 5 minutes more. Remove the lid and add the chicken stock. Increase the heat if necessary and simmer, uncovered, until the flavors are blended, 20 minutes or so. Strain the sauce, reserving the mushrooms. Return the sauce to the pot and simmer until it has reduced by 90 percent and has become very concentrated, about 15 minutes. Add the heavy cream and simmer until the sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon. Add lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm over a very low heat. Just before serving, add the reserved mushrooms and fresh herbs.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nPut the ramps in an oven-proof medium skillet. Add the stick of butter, the honey, and enough water to cover the mushrooms. Simmer over medium heat until the water evaporates, about 10 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the ramps begin to brown. Transfer the pan to the oven and cook until the ramps are tender, about 5 minutes more. Set aside.\nMeanwhile, in a large oven-proof skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until the fat renders and the bacon begins to crisp, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Add the potatoes to the hot bacon fat. Increase the heat to medium-high then season with salt and pepper. Cook, turning the potatoes in the hot fat until they begin to brown, about 7 minutes. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter to the potatoes. Transfer the potatoes to the oven and continue cooking until the potatoes are tender, about 7 minutes more. Set the potatoes aside.

Bring to a boil again. Reduce to a simmer and cover. Cook for about 1 hour. Remove the chicken and set aside. Maintain a medium heat under the broth as you'll use it again for this recipe.\nFor the roasted vegetables: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and roast until the skins are blistered and the vegetables softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool. Once cooled, remove the foil and peel the garlic and the skins off the tomatoes.\nFor the mole: In a large heavy saute pan heat 1 cup lard.

Add the chiles into the pot of chicken broth and simmer for 10 minutes.\nIn the meantime, add 2 tablespoons lard to the saute pan and fry the roasted onions and garlic. Add the tortilla and bolillo and cook for 5 minutes.

    "instructions": "Special equipment: A smoker; whiskey, hickory or applewood chips\nSoak the wood chips in water for 30 minutes, then transfer to the smoker. Smoke the pork for 2 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. Combine the brown sugar, chili sauce, molasses, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger and garlic in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper and whisk until combined. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper. Heat a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat and sear the pork on all sides. Pour half the molasses mixture over the pork. Cover and cook in the oven until the meat is so tender it falls off the bone, about 6 hours. Let rest for 30 minutes. Remove the pork from the skillet and use a fork to pull and shred the meat (it will come off in threads). Set aside. Skim the fat from the surface of the braising liquid. Pour the remaining molasses mixture into the skillet and cook over medium-high heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Pile the pork, cheese, a drizzle of the sauce, some kimchi and more cheese between the bread slices to make 4 sandwiches. Grill in a panini press. Cook's Note: If you don't have a smoker, you can skip that step or smoke the pork in a covered grill.\nDissolve the salt in 12 cups (3 liters) cold water. Add the cabbage and refrigerate for 4 hours. Rinse the cabbage thoroughly under cold running water at least 3 times. Pat dry. Bring 1 1/2 cups (375ml) water to a simmer in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the flour and whisk for 3 minutes.

    "instructions": "Put the ham in a large stockpot, and fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the ham. Bring the water to 170 to 180 degrees F (below the boil; if boiled, the ham will crack open at the joint). Cook at that temperature for 3 hours, then let cool in the cooking water.\nWhen ready to proceed with the recipe, remove the ham from the water. With a knife, remove the skin from the ham, and trim the surface of the meat where it is brown and skin-like around the shank bone. To make carving easier later, remove the pelvis or hipbone by running a knife around it. When the skin has been removed, trim off all but a thin layer of white fat from the surface of the ham.\nRun the point of your knife in a crisscross pattern through the remaining fat on the top of the ham, cutting slightly into the surface of the meat. This scoring will help the glaze adhere to the meat while it cooks. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nIn a small bowl, mix the preserves, pepper, mustard, balsamic vinegar, and allspice together.\nSpread the glaze coating on the top surface of the ham, place it in a roasting pan, and bake in the 350 degree F oven for 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F, and continue cooking the ham for 1 hour. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top, and cook for another 30 minutes, until nicely glazed. Transfer the ham to a platter, and set it aside in a warm place while you make the peach sauce. Discard the accumulated fat in the roasting pan, and add the 1 cup of water to the drippings in the pan, stirring to loosen and mix in the solidified juices. Add the demi-glace, and bring to a boil. Reserve for use in peach sauce.\nFor the peach sauce: Heat the butter in two large skillets, 2 tablespoons of butter per skillet. When it is hot, add half of the peach wedges to each skillet, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar, dividing it between the skillets, and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the dried peach julienne and the vinegar, half to each skillet, and stir to mix. Combine the contents of both skillets in one saucepan. Strain the reserved demi-glace mixture over the peaches, and stir in the salt. If the sauce is thinner than you would like, add the dissolved potato starch, and bring to a boil. Boil 1 or 2 minutes. At serving time, stir in the basil.\nTo make carving easier, make a vertical cut down into the ham approximately 1-inch above the shank bone. The object is to make a guard that your knife will not go beyond when you slice the ham; this will give a clean bottom edge to the slices and also protect your hand from the knife in case it happens to slide while you are slicing the meat. Slice the ham on the bias, stopping at the cut edge, and arrange the meat on a warm platter. Serve 3 or 4 slices of ham per person with few slices of the peaches and the sauce spooned around and over the meat.",

Remember that eventually the bottom will be the top so it is important for the first circles of potatoes to look pretty.

    "instructions": "There are a lot of little tricks to handling chocolate. I like to work on a marble surface because the marble is generally cold, which helps the chocolate set. I also keep my chocolate in a glass bowl, which retains heat well and holds the temper longer. One of the most useful things you can use when working with chocolate is acetate (plastic from the florist). It can be found in most art shops.\nTo make dark and white chocolate cigarettes: Use a cake comb to create alternating stripes of white and dark chocolate. You can buy one at most cake decorating supply stores. Spread some white chocolate on a sheet of acetate in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch. Draw the comb through the chocolate to create alternating lines. Return the excess chocolate to the bowl. When the chocolate stripes are firm but not hard, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate. When the chocolate sets but is not firm, use a pastry triangle to create the cigarettes. Start about 11/2 inches from an edge and push the chocolate into a roll (it will form naturally). Apply even pressure.\nTo make chocolate fans: Spread some dark chocolate directly onto the marble surface in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch. Use the pastry triangle to create fans by pushing the triangle through the chocolate in an arc. Use your finger to hold down one side as you push the chocolate toward the other.",

    "instructions": "Steep 1 cup Darjeeling tea leaves in 4 cups boiling water for 7 minutes. Strain tea leaves and reduce to 3/4 cup. Grind spice to powder. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. In a large heat-proof mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and sugar. Place the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Warm just until bubbles form around the edge. Remove from heat and, whisking constantly, pour into the egg and sugar mixture. Add the spice powder and the reduced tea liquid. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well combined. Pour the mixture through a very fine sieve into 6 creme brulee dishes, filling them only half full. Place the dishes into a shallow baking dish large to hold them without crowding. Place the dish on the middle rack oven. Working quickly to preserve the heat, finish filling the dishes with the custard mixture, making sure that it comes right to the top of each dish. Then carefully fill the baking dish with very hot tap water so it comes halfway up the sides of the filled dishes. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the custard is set in the center. Remove the custards to a wire rack to cool. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until ready to use. When ready to serve, preheat the broiler. Pass the brown sugar through a fine sieve to eliminate all lumps. Generously sprinkle the top of each chilled custard with an equal portion of the brown sugar, taking care to cover all of the custard, so that it gives an even finish. Place the chilled creme brulee dishes under the preheated broiler and broil for about 2 minutes, or until the tops are crackling brown. Remove from the broiler and serve immediately.",

Remove from the heat and add the mussels and 1/4 cup of the vermouth. Return the skillet to the stove and cook for 1 minute. Add about 3/4 cup water. The mussels shouldn't take long to cook, about 2 minutes. Take care to stir the mussels from time to time so they cook as evenly as possible. Use tongs to pluck the mussels from the pan as they open. When all of the mussels are open, remove them and strain the liquid, reserving it for the sauce. Remove the mussels from their shells. Discard the shells.\nCook the mushrooms: Rinse the skillet and return it to high heat until it smokes lightly. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and swirl the pan until the butter turns a light brown color. Return the skillet to the heat and immediately add the shallots and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook the mushrooms until they start to give up liquid and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup vermouth and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Toast the hazelnuts: Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat and add the hazelnuts. Season them lightly with salt and toast them over low heat until they turn light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the hazelnuts and transfer them to a cutting board. Roughly chop the hazelnuts.\nMake the sauce: Transfer the mushrooms to a plate using a slotted spoon. If there is any cooking liquid from the mushrooms, combine it with the mussel cooking liquid in a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 1 minute. The sauce may need a pinch of salt. The flavor should be an initial taste of sweet mussel followed by an undertone of earthiness from the mushroom. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the butter and a touch of lemon juice. Keep warm.\nAssemble the dish: Heat a large skillet over high heat until hot, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When it turns light brown, return the skillet to the burner and add the mussels and mushrooms in a single layer. Cook for 1 minute without stirring them.

Lightly sprinkle a clean work surface with confectioners' sugar. Place the chilled dough on the work surface. Roll out dough to 1/8-inch thick. (Save the scraps to refrigerate and roll out again.) Using a 2-inch cookie cutter, cut out the cookies, and place on the prepared baking sheets, about 1/2-inch apart. You should be able to fit about 35 cookies on a baking sheet. Bake until you can smell the chocolate, about 12 minutes. Remove to a rack to cool.\nMeanwhile, make the ganache: In a small saucepan, bring cream to a boil over medium-high heat. Very finely chop 6 ounces of chocolate, and add to hot cream. Stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Add peppermint oil. Let cool slightly, about 10 to 15 minutes.\nTransfer ganache to a pastry bag fitted with a #11 tip. Pipe out quarter-size amounts of chocolate, about 1 teaspoon each, onto the center of half the cooled wafers. Top with the remaining wafers. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, about 10 minutes.\nMelt remaining chocolate in the top of a double boiler over medium heat. Let cool slightly. Dip 1 side of the cookie sandwich to coat. Remove excess chocolate by scraping the cookie against the side of the bowl. Return to the refrigerator until chocolate is set, about 10 minutes.",

As soon as it simmers, turn off the heat and add the gelatin mixture, stirring to dissolve the gelatin.

Shave some chocolate curls onto the top of the panna cottas and serve with the orange supremes.\nNotes about the recipe: I love panna cotta because you can combine milks and creams to make it sweeter, more tart, or creamier. And then the flavor can be anything you can imagine goes well with dairy¿raspberry, citrus, coffee, tea, what ever! So it's one of those really flexible desserts that you can tailor to fit the flavors in the rest of your menu, and \"flexible\" almost never happens when it comes to a dessert recipe. Also, you can vary the container you make it in and turn it out to serve it or leave it in. Try using eggcups, demitasse cups, a hollowed out clean eggshell, shot glasses, anything will do. These are ingredients you might already have in your kitchen, too, so it cuts down on shopping, which is key for me.

    "instructions": "Making an ice sculpture is very easy if you use this method. The molds I used are decorative and easy to unmold because they are flexible. All you are doing in this recipe is freezing water.\nSelect flexible silicone molds to create the sculpture base and cake stand. I used 3 molds. For the sculpture base, I used a small sunflower and centered it in the mold (place flowers upside down). When the flower is in place, fill the mold 1/3 full with water. Place the mold in the freezer. If all of the water is added at this time, the flower will float to the top. When the water has frozen, remove the mold from the freezer and add more water so the mold is 2/3's full. Return the mold to the freezer. The mold must be filled in stages to keep the previously frozen ice from floating to the top of the mold. When the additional water is frozen, remove from the freezer, fill the mold with water and return to the freezer. Repeat these steps using the other molds and use any flowers or fresh leaves to decorate your sculpture.\nApply the same technique to plastic water bottle that has been cut to size. This can be the column that supports the other ice bases.\nWhen all of the pieces have been frozen, use a box grater or a wood plainer to flatten the surface of the mold. It is especially important to flatten the spot where 2 pieces are joined together. Sprinkle a little of the ice shaving on the spot. Wet with a little water and immediately \"glue\" 2 pieces together. Put the whole sculpture back in the freezer until ready to use.\nWhen the entire mold is frozen, it is ready to be displayed.",

Grease paper and set sheet aside. Reserve any remaining melted butter for later. Line two more shallow baking sheets or trays with waxed paper for holding and chilling assembled candy and set them aside. Cut each stick of butter in half and place next to work surface, along with measured salt, baking soda, vanilla and coarsely chopped macadamia nuts. Place chopped chocolate in a heat proof bowl and set aside. Place a cup of hot water next to stove and put a pastry brush in water.\nTo prepare toffee: Place a 2 1/2 quart heavy bottomed saucepan on the stove. Place water, sugar and corn syrup in the pan and stir gently to combine. Place pan over medium heat and as sugar dissolves, swirl pan gently. Let mixture come to a rolling boil and, once boiling and mixture is clear, don't stir or swirl pan anymore. If, while sugar is boiling, any sugar crystals cling to sides of pan, use moistened pastry brush to wash sides of the pan. Cook syrup until starts becoming a very light amber color. Lower heat and add butter, one half stick at a time, stirring very gently. (Only add additional butter after preceding piece has become melted and fully incorporated.) Once all the butter has been added, place candy thermometer into mixture, making sure that the bottom tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Raise heat to medium and boil mixture until the temperature reads between 295 degrees F and 300 degrees F. Remove thermometer from pan and pan from stove and immediately stir in salt, baking soda, vanilla and macadamia nuts. (Quickly stick thermometer it warm water to aid in clean up.) Immediately, pour candy mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Brush the bottom of a long offset metal spatula (an icing spatula is perfect) or a knife with some melted butter. Spread the candy mixture out so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Use the knife to push the sides back into a rectangular shape as the mixture cools. Let the mixture set for a few minutes.\nTo melt chocolate: While toffee firms up a bit, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a skillet with 1 inch of hot but not simmering water (stirring constantly until smooth). Be careful not to allow any water to enter bowl of chocolate.\nTo cut candy: While candy mixture is still warm and pliable, use a buttered pastry scraper to score the candy into 1 1/2 by 2inch rectangles. Let set further until the candy is firmer (5 minutes at room temperature). Score again through original cuts, making sure candy is in separate squares all the way through to the bottom. ( If stubborn, use your pastry scraper and mallet to knock through any sticky, tough spots. Hit the top (wooden part) of the scraper with a heavy mallet.)\nTo fully assemble candy and chill: When chocolate is firm, pour melted chocolate over top of scored candy and, using a spatula, spread it out evenly. It's okay if the chocolate runs down into grooves in candy. Scatter 2 cups of the ground toasted nuts on top of the chocolate and press them into the chocolate. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of nuts. Lift one end of the parchment paper so the first line of cut candy bends and separates from the next line. Carefully lift one piece off at a time. Sprinkle with some additional nuts to coat any exposed chocolate. Place candy on prepared baking sheets lined with waxed paper (in a single layer) and refrigerate (covered with plastic wrap) so chocolate will harden. Once set, place candy in an airtight tin, separated in layers with waxed paper.

    "instructions": "In a large bowl, stir yeast into water to soften. Add milk, butter, sugar, lemon rind, eggs, salt, mace, and 2 cups flour. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes.\nGradually add flour, 1/4 cup at a time, until the dough begins to pull away from the side of the bowl.\nTurn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, adding flour a little at a time, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.\nPut dough into an oiled bowl. Turn to coat the entire ball of dough with oil. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.\nTurn dough out onto a lightly oiled work surface and divide in half. Using a rolling pin, roll half of the dough into a 22 by 9-inch rectangle. Cover and let rest 5 minutes on the work surface.\nCut the dough into three 22-inch long strips.\nMix the nuts and candied fruit. Fill the center of each strip with 1/2 cup of the nut and fruit mixture. Bring edges together and pinch to seal forming three 22-inch-long strands.\nLay the strands side-by-side on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Turn the baking sheet so the strands are facing lengthwise away from you. Starting in the center of the strands, place the right strand over the middle strand (the right strand has now become the middle strand), then the left strand over the middle, the right over the middle, left over the middle, etc. Continue this process until the strands are too short to braid. Do not pinch the end together.\nTo braid the other end of the loaf, turn the baking sheet around so that the unbraided portion is facing you. Place the middle strand over the right strand, then middle strand over the left, middle over the right, middle over the left, etc., until the ends are too short to braid. Join the ends of the braid to form a wreath, and pinch to seal. Repeat with the other half of the dough. Cover with a tightly woven towel and let rise until almost doubled, about 45 minutes.\nAbout 10 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nBake for 25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaf reaches 190 degrees.\nImmediately remove bread from baking sheet and cool on a rack for 20 minutes.\nCombine powdered sugar and cream. Mixture should be the consistency of honey (if it isn't, adjust by adding more cream to thin it or powdered sugar to thicken it). Drizzle over the top of each wreath.",

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nThere are rubs and there are brines. A brine is a slower process where the rub, sugar and salt are diluted to penetrate the protein and break it down so that the meat is juicy, flavorful and tender after cooked. I love brined pork and chicken, but if I am cooking late and didn't think about it the day before, I will have to do a nice rub on the meat, which is just more concentrated and expedited, and that's what I have here. Pork chops go with so many accompaniments but I do love the acidity of apples or an applesauce with pork chops and the bite of mustard greens. You can use mizuna, or arugula if you cannot find mustard greens. Also, you can put a schmear of hot mustard mixed with a little honey or molasses on the plate instead for the kick. I like onion rings, in general. My other favorite accompaniment to pork chops is kimchee tossed with some fresh fruit such as peaches or plums.\nTo cook the pork chops: Grind all the spices together with the sugar and rub all over the pork chops. Set aside for 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature.\nPreheat the grill on high or heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat on the stovetop and preheat the oven to 375 degrees (Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan if cooking in cast iron).\nCook the pork on one side for 4 to 5 minutes on the grill or in cast iron. Flip over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the grill; if cooking in cast iron, flip the chop and transfer to the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.\nTo cook the sauteed apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon water and a drop of lemon juice. Cook until sugar caramelizes to golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the apple slices and star anise. Return the pan to medium-high heat, stir in the butter and remaining lemon juice. Saute, stirring, for 2 minutes, adding the brandy in the last minute of cooking with a pinch of salt. Simmer briefly to burn off the alcohol and thicken the caramel. Set aside.\nTo cook the onion rings: Bring the canola oil to 360 degrees F in a large pot. Combine the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish or bowl. Dip the onion rings in the flour mixture to dredge, shaking off any excess. Dip in the buttermilk to coat, and then back into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Working in batches, fry the rings until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.

(If using dry yeast, mix the yeast with 2 tablespoons of the milk and 2 tablespoons sugar and let sit until foamy, about 5 to 10 minutes and add to the flour.)\nAdd the eggs and butter to the flour mixture. Begin to mix the ingredients into a soft, but not sticky, dough. Add a little extra milk, 1 tablespoon at a time. Work in extra flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. (You can do this in a mixer fitted with a dough hook.) Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 2 hours.\nPunch down the risen dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for a few seconds. With a lightly floured rolling pin, gradually roll out the dough to about 1/2-inch thick. When rolling dough, let it rest periodically to relax. Cut out into 3 to 4-inch rounds with a lightly floured biscuit cutter. Re-roll the scraps to make more rounds. Place the doughnuts on lightly floured baking sheets, spacing them apart, and cover lightly with a dry towel. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 20 minutes.\nTransfer the risen doughnuts to a heavy pot filled 3-inches high with vegetable oil at 350 degrees F.

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Brush 3 (12 1/2 by 9-inch) rimmed baking sheets (otherwise known as quarter sheet pans) with melted butter. Line the pans with parchment paper, leaving a few inches of overhang on opposite sides. Butter the top of the parchment paper as well, then set aside.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond paste and sugar on medium speed until well combined, about 5 minutes. Add the almond extract. Roughly cut the room temperature butter into pats and gradually add to the almond paste-sugar mixture. Beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to combine after each addition. Add the flour and salt and beat until just combined.\nDivide the batter evenly among the prepared baking sheets, about 2 1/4 cups each sheet, smoothing the batter out with an offset spatula. Gently tap the baking sheet on the table to remove any air pockets in the batter. Air pockets will cause holes in the baked cake and give a ragged look to the finished product. Bake until just set, but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Give the baking sheets a turn halfway through baking, after about 8 minutes, for even baking, if needed, but don't worry too much because we're covering the cakes. Test with a toothpick or skewer and if clean, remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool.\nTo make the jam easier to spread and to prevent tearing the cake, puree the raspberry jam in a food processor. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn 1 cake layer out onto the lined baking sheet. Spread half of the raspberry jam in an even layer over the cake. Carefully flip the cake out of the baking sheet and top with a second cake layer. Spread with the remaining jam. Carefully flip the final layer out of the baking sheet and top the cake. Place a piece of parchment paper over the final layer and top with a second baking sheet. Weigh down with 2 large (28-ounce) cans. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and cut into 1-inch squares. Place onto a wire racks over at least 2 baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch between each cake piece.\nPlace each of the tinted royals icings in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, with the bottom of the bowl not touching the water, until pourable. You should have about 8 cups total. You'll be using about 1 heaping tablespoon icing on each. Carefully place a cut cake on a chocolate fork/dipper (or a small fork). Place the cake over the icing and spoon the icing onto the cake. If the cake drops into the icing, carefully pick it up with your spoon and place back onto your fork/dipper. Place back onto the wire rack using another dipper or fork to slide onto the wire rack. Top with decorative dragees, as desired. Repeat with the remaining icing and cakes. Alternately, for each tinted frosting, set 3 cooling racks over baking sheets and divide the cut cake pieces evenly among the racks. Pour the tinted frosting slowly over the cake pieces. If you need extra frosting, just remove the cooling rack, scrape the excess frosting from the baking sheet, melt or microwave until pourable and touch up any area that the frosting didn't coat the first time. Let stand until set, about 30 minutes at room temperature or cover and place in the refrigerator for up to 1 week until ready to serve.\nPut your raspberries and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat. Once it's at a simmer, partially cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes. Pass the berry mixture through a food mill and measure the liquid that remains. You need 3 1/2 cups. Add more water if there isn't enough.\nPut the berry liquid into a new saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer again. Once it simmers, start adding your sugar in 1/2 cup increments. Give it a stir to incorporate and bring it back to a simmer before adding of the next 1/2 cup sugar. Once the last 1/2 cup is added, bring the liquid to 216 to 218 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Stir constantly.\nLet this cool to room temperature prior to using. If not using right away, refrigerate for up to 1 week. Yield: 2 cups.\nIn a large heatproof bowl, combine 1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon water, corn syrup and almond extract. Once incorporated, slowly whisk in the sugar until fully combined. Alternately, slowly mix together in a stand mixer and transfer to a heatproof bowl prior to icing cakes.\nDivide the icing into 3 heatproof bowls. To make a pale green color, add a little less than 1 drop green food coloring to the first bowl. To the second bowl, add 1 drop purple coloring for a lavender color. And leave the final bowl white, or add another color, as desired.",

    "instructions": "Special equipment: A deep-fry thermometer A flexible bench scraper\nFor the dough: Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium heat just until bubbles form around the edge. Transfer the milk to a small bowl and let it cool to about 110 degrees F.\nMeanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt.\nAdd the egg to the milk and whisk to combine. With a wooden spoon, add the milk mixture to the flour mixture and stir it into a ball. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough until it is smooth, about 5 minutes. You can add a little bit more flour at this point if necessary.\nNext, knead the butter into the dough piece by piece, using a flexible bench scraper to scrape the butter back into the dough as you knead. The dough will seem sticky and buttery, but don't add more flour. Just keep kneading and stretching the dough until the butter is completely absorbed and the dough is smooth. Pop the dough into a buttered bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\nFor the apple mixture: The next day, toss the apples with the cider vinegar in a medium bowl.\nIn a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the melted butter and cook, stirring, until the sugar turns deep golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. (The butter and sugar may separate. Don't worry.) Add the apples and toss to combine. Cook until the apples release some of their juice and are just tender but still hold their shape, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the apples to a plate. Cook the remaining liquid down until thick and syrupy, about 3 minutes more. Drizzle the caramel over the apples and toss gently to combine. Let cool to room temperature.\nPull the dough out of the fridge. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, with the short sides at the bottom and the top, about 1/4 inch thick. Use a slotted spoon to transfer half the apples to the bottom half of the rectangle. Leave most of the apple liquid behind. Fold the top half of the dough over the bottom half. Press the dough down to seal in the apples. Spread the rest of the apples, without too much of that liquid, on the right half of the dough square. Then fold the left half of the dough over the apples and press to seal. Roll this into a ball, transfer it to a buttered bowl, cover lightly and set aside to double, about an hour.\nOn a floured surface, tip the doubled dough out and press it into a big square. Use the bench scraper to cut the dough into 12 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a rough ball as best you can. Don't worry if they seem messy or apples pop out. Just smoosh them back together and proceed. Transfer the pieces to well-floured baking sheets. Cover lightly with plastic and let stand until puffed, about an hour.\nHeat 3 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot to 360 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with paper towel.\nFor the glaze: Meanwhile, whisk together the confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla in a bowl. Add more milk or a little water if necessary. It should be runny.\nVery carefully transfer a puffed piece of dough to a large spider or spatula and lower it into the oil. Add a few more dough balls, but don't crowd the pan. Cook until they are golden brown and puffed, 2 to 3 minutes, flipping halfway through. Make sure to keep the oil temperature between 350 to 360 degrees F. Lift the fritters out with the spider and set them on the paper towel-lined baking sheet for about 3 minutes.\nTransfer the fritters to a rack and use a pastry brush to cover them in glaze. Serve hot or at room temperature.",

Butter the inside of the springform pan.\nPulse the graham crackers in a food processor until finely ground. Add the butter, sugar and salt, and pulse until the mixture comes together and holds its shape when squeezed. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan, and press it into the bottom to make an even layer. Bake until the crust is just firm, about 10 minutes. Remove and let cool completely. Place the pan on a large piece of foil, and fold the foil up the sides of the pan. (This helps seal the pan, to keep water out while baking.)\nFor the filling: Wipe out the food processor. Pulse the cream cheese, sugar and sour cream until completely smooth, without any lumps, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times. Add the eggs and vanilla, and pulse until incorporated. Pour the filling into the crust, and set the pan inside a roasting pan. Fill the roasting pan with enough hot water to go halfway up the sides of the springform pan (but not above the foil).\nBake the cheesecake until the edge is set but the center jiggles slightly (when you gently shake the pan, the cheesecake should move in a cohesive wave motion), 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Turn the oven off, and open the door for a few seconds to let out some heat. Close the door, and let the cheesecake sit in the oven until cooked completely through, 1 hour more.\nTransfer the springform pan to a cooling rack. Run a knife around the edge, and let the cheesecake cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate overnight or up to 2 days.\nFor the topping: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet, and bake until they turn a few shades darker and are nicely toasted, about 15 minutes. Let cool, then halve each pecan lengthwise.\nMeanwhile, heat the cream, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until just steaming. Reduce the heat to low to keep the cream mixture warm.\nCook the sugar in an even layer in a medium skillet over medium heat, without stirring, until it begins to melt. Gently swirl the pan as needed as the sugar continues to melt and begins to caramelize and turn lightly golden in spots. Keep cooking and swirling until the caramel is a uniform deep amber. Remove from the heat, and slowly whisk in the warm cream mixture (watch out for ferocious bubbles). Return the caramel sauce to medium heat, and cook to reduce slightly, about 2 minutes. Let cool. To see if the sauce is ready for topping the cheesecake, dip a spoon into it and let the sauce drop off; it's ready if it easily and slowly drips off the spoon. (The sauce can be refrigerated up to 2 days; reheat in the microwave.)\nTo assemble: Spoon the sauce into the center of the cheesecake, and let it ooze to the edge. If needed, swirl the sauce with the back of a spoon to help it along. Sprinkle the pecans in a generous layer over the sauce. The cheesecake can now be served or refrigerated for up to 4 hours.\nTo slice the cake, dip a sharp, heavy knife into warm water, wipe the knife dry and slice into the cake.

Mix first with a spoon and then with your hand, to make a smooth dough. 3) Add extra flour, as needed, to keep the dough from being sticky. The dough will be quite soft. knead in the bowl for about 5 minutes. Cover tightly and refrigerate until you are ready to assemble the pastries.\nFilling: 1) Peel the potatoes and chop them into 1-inch pieces. Place in a saucepan, cover with water, and boil until very soft. Drain and transfer to a medium-sized bowl. Mash and set aside. 2)Melt the butter in a heavy skillet. Add onion, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds, coriander, and salt. Saute over medium heat about 8 to 10 minutes, or until onions are quite soft. Add this to the mashed potatoes, along with the remaining ingredients. Mix well, but try not to smash the peas. Cool for at least 15 minutes before filling the pastries.\nTo Assemble and Bake: 1) Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Generously oil a baking sheet. 2) Keep a small container of flour, a fork, a small bowl of water, and a pastry brush close at hand. Flour a clean surface, and, one by one, roll 1-inch balls of dough into 5-inch circles, using a rolling pin. 3) Place approximately 1 1/2 tablespoons filling in the center of each circle, and fold over, just like a turnover. Brush the inside edges of each circle with a little water, and fold the edges together to make a small hem. Crimp the edges firmly with a fork. Store in the refrigerator or freezer until baking time. 4) To bake: Place the samosas on the oiled baking sheet. Brush the tops with oil. Bake 15 minutes at 425 degrees F., then reduce heat to 375 degrees F. and bake for 10 minutes more. For maximum crispness, turn the samosas over when you turn the oven down. 5) Serve within 5 minutes of baking, with Dipping Sauce. A nice way to serve the sauce is in individual saucers or tiny bowls, so each person can hold both samosa and sauce directly under his or her face while eating, and the sauce bowl can catch the drips. (It does drip, but that's one of the charms of this ritual.)\nFor the dipping sauce: 1) Place all ingredients in a small saucepan.

    "instructions": "To make the pastry: combine the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the butter and mix with a pastry blender or hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the middle of the pastry. Combine the egg yolk with the ice water in a small bowl, whisking to blend; pour it into the well and work it in to bind the dough until it holds together without being too wet or sticky. Squeeze a small amount together, if it is crumbly, add more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Form the dough into a disk and wrap in plastic; refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\nRoll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle, about 1/4-inch thick. Carefully roll the dough up onto the pin (this may take a little practice) and lay it inside a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the pan so it fits tightly; press the edges into the sides of the pan. It is important to press the dough evenly into every nook and corner of the ring, especially the scalloped edges. Shave off the excess hanging dough with a knife. Put the tart in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to relax.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nPlace the tart pan on a sturdy cookie sheet so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven. Line the tart with aluminum foil and add pie weights or dried beans to keep the sides of the tart from buckling. Bake for 30 minutes, then remove the foil and weights. Using a pastry brush, lightly coat the crust with a beaten egg white. Return to the oven and continue to bake for another 8 minutes until the tart is golden in color, but not brown. Remember the tart will be cooked again with the filling. It should be cooked but light in color so that it will not burn on the second bake. Set aside to cool and lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees F.\nTo make the filling: Heat the heavy cream and milk in a pot over medium-low flame, until it simmers slightly around the edges. Remove from the heat; add the chopped chocolate and stir until melted and smoothed out. Add the sugar and salt and whisk until well incorporated. Beat the eggs in a small bowl until blended and add them to the chocolate mixture, stir until completely blended. Pour the filling into the cooled tart shell and bake at 325 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes until the filling is set and the surface is glossy.

Lightly oil a bowl; add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.\nPrep the toppings: For prosciutto-arugula pizzas, make the chile oil: Bring the chiles and olive oil to a simmer; remove from the heat and let steep 1 hour.

Brush the grill to remove any crud.\nRoll out the dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide into 6 equal pieces.

In a large pot over high heat, bring 6 quarts of water to a rapid boil and blanch the duck for 7 to 8 minutes in hot water. Remove the duck from the water and place on a plate in the refrigerator. Allow the duck to sit 3 to 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and wipe the rendered fat from the skin of the duck. In a medium saucepan, combine the marinade ingredients and cook over low to medium heat until thickened. (Do not boil. This will give the marinade a burnt taste due to the amount of brown sugar). Allow the marinade to cool then brush the duck generously with the mixture. (Reserve some of the marinade to baste the duck with while roasting.) Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade every 5 minutes. Remove the duck from the oven and let rest 10 minutes. Remove the breasts from the bone and the thighs with the legs attached. Place the thigh/legs into a medium saucepan pan with 1-inch of water in it. Cover the pan and place in the 350 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes or until the meat falls off the bone. Remove from the oven and set aside. When cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bone and tear into bite sized-pieces. Just before serving, place the breasts in a oven-proof skillet skin-side-down and heat 6 to 8 minutes (depending on your preference of doneness, i.e. rare, medium rare). Slice the breasts very thinly on the bias (each breast should yield 3 servings). Keep the meat warm until service.\nMake the vinaigrette: In a saucepan over high heat, reduce the orange juice until it forms a syrup. Let cool. In a blender, combine the orange syrup, vinegar, honey and chili powder (if using). Blend for 30 seconds. With the blender running, slowly add the olive oil until the dressing emulsifies. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a plastic squeeze bottle. (May be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.) Bring to room temperature before serving.\nMake the sauteed pears: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon and cook to a light syrup. Add the sliced pears and cook until they are soft but still retain their shape. Set aside.\nMake the peanut brittle Make a caramel with the sugar, add the peanuts and pour onto a lightly greased baking sheet. Let harden and coarsely chop.\nAssemble the salad: In a large bowl dress mesclun greens lightly with some of the orange vinaigrette and arrange on the top halves of 6 plates.

Using a rubber spatula, fold about one-third of the beaten egg whites into the ricotta mixture, then gently fold in the rest until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared crust. Bake until slightly puffed and lightly golden on top, about 1 hour, 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool, 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen, then remove the springform ring and let cool completely. Combine the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon in a fine-mesh sieve and dust over the cheesecake. Scatter the remaining 1/3 cup toasted almonds on top and dust again. Serve at room temperature.

    "instructions": "Pour lemon juice over the avocado slices and set aside. Place chopped romaine in a large bowl and toss with enough blue cheese dressing to lightly coat, about 1/3 cup. Set aside remaining dressing for another use.\nTo assemble salads, place the ring mold on a chilled serving plate and fill with 1 cup of the romaine mixture, making sure that the lettuce fills the whole diameter of the bottom circumference. Carefully place 2 avocado slices on top of the lettuce on the right side of the mold, so that their curvature aligns with the mold. On the opposite side of the avocado, sprinkle corn on top of the lettuce so that it extends 1 1/2 inches from the left side of the mold. Next to the corn, sprinkle a 1/2-inch thick row of diced tomatoes. Next to the tomatoes and meeting the avocado, sprinkle a row of crumbled bacon. Garnish with a very thin row of blue cheese crumbles down the center. Carefully remove the mold by lifting straight up (some ingredients will shift). Repeat with remaining ingredients. Serve immediately.\nCook's Note: If a ring mold is unavailable, use a 12-ounce tuna can (4-inch diameter by 2-inch height) and remove the top and bottom with a can opener.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the mayonnaise, buttermilk, lemon juice, salt, and cumin until smooth.

When the oil is hot, brown the medallions approximately 3 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown and just cooked through. Transfer the meat to a heated plate and keep warm. Pour off any excess fat from the pan.\nDeglaze the pan with the wine, and then reduce to 1/4 of a cup. Add the stock and also add any of the veal juices that have collected on the plate.

Top with 2 veal medallions per plate, and spoon sauce over meat.

Halfway through the baking, quickly rotate the pans in the oven to ensure even baking, but otherwise try not to open the oven. Let cool in the pan 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and let cool completely before frosting.\nTo frost the cake, use a spatula to cover 2 of the cake layers with frosting. Stack them together. Flip the third cake layer over and rest it on the top to create a very flat top for the cake. Frost on the sides and top with a thin \"crumb\" layer to seal all the crumbs in and chill.

    "instructions": "For the sauce:\nHeat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sweat them for 1 minute. Throw in the thyme, marjoram, bay leaf, cloves, and juniper berry and sweat for 1 minute. Add the red wine and let the mixture simmer until the wine is mostly cooked off and the sauce starts to thicken slightly, about 20 to 25 minutes.

Stir in the butter until it is just melted. Taste the sauce again and season with salt, and pepper, if necessary.\nFor the steak and turf:\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Preheat a grill or cast iron pan over high heat.\nRemove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking so the meat is at room temperature. This helps the meat to cook evenly. Coat the steak in 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the steak with salt, and pepper. Sear the steak on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, until browned. Transfer the steak to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest before slicing. While the steak is in the oven, season the fish well with salt and pepper. Wrap thin slices of potato around each piece of fish, overlapping slightly. Do this with each slice overlapping the last by 1/4-inch until the fish is wrapped. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the potato-wrapped fish with salt and pepper and add the fish to the pan with the potato overlap facing down. This will help seal the potatoes on the fish. Cook each side until the potato is crispy and fish is cooked through. Transfer the cooked fish to a paper towel. Keep warm.\nFor the mushrooms:\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn to the pan and cook until lightly browned. Remove the corn from the pan to a bowl. Add another 1 tablespoon of butter and then stir in the shallots. Cook the shallots until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the shallots to the bowl with the corn. Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and raise the heat to medium-high. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to brown, but are still firm. Add the sherry vinegar and stir. Simmer until reduced down and almost cooked out. Add the corn and shallots back into the pan. Stir to combine. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\nFor the leeks:\nIn a large, deep saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the leeks and shallots and sweat the leeks and shallots for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Add the wine and bring to a simmer and let the wine cook all the way down until it is almost cooked out. Add the stock and repeat the reduction process. Add the cream and reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer until the leeks and shallots are tender and the sauce begins to thicken. Season the mixture with salt, and pepper again, if needed.\nTo plate:\nSlice the steak into thin slices. Make a bed of mushrooms on each plate. Top with slices of steak and a piece of fish.

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nPlace the nuts and corn syrup in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place over low heat to liquify the corn syrup. Heat the mixture until the corn syrup is thin enough to coat the nuts evenly, 3 to 4 minutes.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat. Using a large slotted spoon, allow the excess corn syrup to drain as you scoop the coated nuts onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Be sure to spread them in an even layer so they will roast evenly in the oven.\nBake until they are evenly caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes. To test for doneness, you can also break a nut in half and check to see if it is light brown on the inside. Keep an eye on the nuts because the sugar will burn very soon after it caramelizes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and place on a wire rack. When the nuts are completely cooled, break apart any that are clustered together.\nFill a cornet halfway with bittersweet chocolate. Pipe a chocolate circle 1 1/2 inches in diameter onto a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. If you do not have a cornet, you can use a spoon; drop a spoonful of the chocolate onto the parchment paper and spread it into a 1 1/2-inch diameter circle with the back of the spoon. In either case, keep the thickness of the circle as even as possible. Make about 10 circles, then create your own design as you top each circle with the cocoa nibs, roasted nuts, and candied fruit. Work quickly, or the chocolate will set before you've accomplished this. If the nuts and fruit do not stick to the chocolate, lightly dip them in the bowl of tempered chocolate and \"glue\" them to the top of the disk. Repeat the process until you have used all of the bittersweet chocolate, nuts, and candied fruit.\nSet the Mendiants aside to harden until ready to serve. Serve side by side rather than in a pile. Store the Mendiants in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.\nHow to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):\nChocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.\nOne of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate's residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\nAnother way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\nThe classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\nA simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.\nHow to Make a Cornet(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):\nThe Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.",

This toasting process adds the chewy, al dente quality that attracts so many people to risotto.\nOnce the rice is lightly toasted, add the white wine slowly, stirring with a wooden spoon. (A wooden spoon is always preferable when making risotto, as a metal spoon tends to cut or injure the grains of rice. Constant stirring should be avoided for the same reason.)\nPreheat the chicken stock just to the boiling point, then have it ready at stoveside.

Continue adding the stock, 1 cup at a time, until all the stock has been absorbed.\n(Adding the liquid in stages, instead of all at once, allows the grains of rice to expand more fully, adding to the risotto's creamy texture.)

When the peppers are done, use tongs to put them in a ziptop bag which (for safety reasons) you have resting on a plate - (Remember, they're volcanically hot!). Carefully zip the bag shut, and allow them to sweat for 5 minutes. Use oven mitts to prevent getting burned while you handle the bag in the next step of sliding the peppers from the bag into a bowl filled with a couple of inches of ice water. You can then use your fingers to work quickly to slip off and discard the skins of the peppers while they are in the water. You will be left with beautifully cooked red peppers with a wonderful color. Remove stem and seeds. Chop the peppers and add them to the simmering chicken stock mixture, and continue simmering until reduced by half, about 20 minutes.

    "instructions": "Prepare the polenta: Line an 8 by 4-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap and set aside.\nBring the water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add the salt, then gradually sprinkle in the cornmeal, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Keep stirring after the last of the cornmeal has been added: the mixture will begin to thicken quite quickly. Reduce the heat to medium and cook the polenta for about 30 to 40 minutes, stirring frequently. Spoon a little of the polenta onto a plate and taste it: when it is no longer crunchy and granular, it's done.\nScrape the polenta into the loaf pan, flattening the top and pressing the mass into a rough rectangle, ending halfway to two-thirds down the length of the pan. This sounds a little confusing, but you should now have a 2-inch-thick rectangle of polenta pressed into the loaf pan. It will be very stiff and have no trouble staying put. Cool the polenta to room temperature, then press a piece of plastic wrap onto the surface and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days.\nNo more that 2 or 3 hours before you plan to serve the dessert, remove the loaf pan from the refrigerator and unmold the polenta. With a long, thin-bladed knife, slice the loaf into 1/4-inch thick slices and cut each of these in half. You should end up with about 24 (2-inch) squares, 1/4-inch thick.\nHeat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1/2 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan (non-stick is fine) over medium heat. When the foam subsides, add half of the polenta slices and fry about 4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp on both sides. Carefully transfer the slices to a platter lined with paper towels and sprinkle the slices with half of the sugar. Repeat with the remaining butter, oil, polenta, and sugar. Cool the sugared polenta slices to room temperature.\nTo assemble the crostini, spoon the mascarpone into a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip (about 1/2-inch or so). Pipe a generous amount of mascarpone on each polenta square and arrange two or three raspberries on the cheese. Press some pistachio pieces around the berries into the cheese and drizzle the crostini with a little of the honey (a honey dripper or even a teaspoon dipped into the jar then waved over the squares works really well, don't even bother measuring the honey!).

Punch the dough down, and transfer it to the baking sheet. Gently stretch and pat the dough to the edges of the baking sheet with your hands (it will recede slightly from the edges).

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Quarter the chickens. Be careful to leave the breasts covered with skin. Be sure the oyster is left attached to the leg. Remove the thighbone and carefully cut off the drumsticks. Reserve until needed. In a large heavy bottomed stock pot, brown the bones and trimmings from the chickens with the chopped carrots and onions. Pour off the excess fat and moisten with the chicken or veal stock. Add the tomato paste and the bouquet garni. This produces an enriched stock for the sauce. Cook at a low simmer for 40 to 45 minutes, then strain and skim off any excess fat. Next gather all ingredients for the sauce, and measure out the wine and cognac. To assemble the dish, season the chicken with salt and pepper. In a large saute pan heat clarified butter and brown the chicken skin side down. When the chicken is browned, remove it from the pan and into a 375 degree oven. Remove excess fat from the pan, return the pan to the heat and saute the mushroom slices. After 2 minutes add the chopped shallots and saute for a couple of minutes longer. Remove the pan from the heat and add the Cognac. Return the pan to the heat and ignite the Cognac. When the flames have died down add the white wine. Reduce by half. Strain the reinforced stock and skim off any fat that has floated to the top. Add the stock to the mushroom mixture and continue reducing. Add the tomato concasse. When the sauce begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon, swirl in the butter. Once the butter is incorporated and the chopped chervil and tarragon to taste. To assemble the dish, remove the chicken pieces from the oven. Remove the breastbone from the chicken breast. The advantage to removing the breastbone after cooking is that it helps the breast keep its shape and remain moist during cooking. Since breast tend to cook more quickly than thighs, removing the thighbone and leaving the breastbone intact during cooking ensures that the two are done at the same time.

    "instructions": "Special equipment: A 13-by-5-inch loaf pan, 1 3/4-inch number cookie cutters, a wooden dowel, disposable pastry bags or large resealable plastic bags and a cake board\nFor the chocolate cake numbers: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13-by-5-inch loaf pan with a strip of aluminum foil. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the dark chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, milk, sour cream, oil and eggs in a mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 52 to 58 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and set on a cooling rack to cool completely. Cut the domed top off the cake and about 1/4 inch off each end. Slice the cake into 13 equal slices. Freeze slices for 1 hour. Remove the cake from the freezer, set on a cutting board, and cut using small 1 3/4-inch number cookie cutters. To remove the cake from the cookie cutters, use a wood dowel to gently push the pieces out. To make a Sweet 16 cake, cut a 1 and 6 out of each cake slice. Line a baking sheet or cutting board with a nonstick silicone mat, nonstick foil or parchment paper. Set the cake numbers on top, cover, and freeze for at least one hour. For the tie-dye cake: Once the cake numbers are frozen, make the colorful cake batter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 13-by-5-inch loaf pan with a strip of aluminum foil. Spray the pan with nonstick cooking spray. Combine the white cake mix, white chocolate pudding mix, milk, sour cream, oil and egg whites in a mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then on medium speed for 2 minutes. Equally divide the batter among 7 bowls. Color one bowl purple, one royal blue, one sky blue, one green, one yellow, one orange and one red using the food coloring. Pour each colored batter into a disposable pastry bag or large resealable plastic bag. Snip the tip off each bag. Pipe squiggles of purple batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, leaving room for other colors in between the squiggles. Pipe another color on top, then another and another. Pipe all 7 colors on the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Remove the cake numbers from the freezer. If any of the numbers have holes in them, pipe in 2 different batter colors, filling the hole two-thirds full. Pipe a very thin amount of batter up against one short side of the loaf pan. Press the cake numbers up against the batter. Press another cake number up against the first number and continue adding cake numbers until you have a row of them going down the length of the entire pan. If using more than 1 number, pipe squiggles of colored batter in between the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Pipe squiggles of colored batter around the outside of the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Pipe squiggles of colored batter on top of the numbers, alternating colors as you go. Smooth out the top of the cake. Do not swirl the colored batter in the pan. Tap the pan on the counter 5 times to help remove big air bubbles. Bake the cake until the top is deep brown and a long toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan for 10 minutes, then remove and set on a cooling rack to cool completely. Cut the domed top off the cake and about 1/4 inch off each end. Trim off a thin layer from each long side of the cake. Optionally, freeze the cake until firm. Set the cake on a cake board that is cut 1/4 inch larger than the loaf on all 4 sides. Mark one end of the cake board. Set the cake so the numbers face forward on the marked end of the cake board. For the frosting: Beat the confectioners' sugar, shortening, whipping cream, vanilla and marshmallow creme until light and fluffy. Frost the cake.\nFor the rainbow-colored glaze: Combine the finely chopped candy melts, whipping cream and corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat on high in 15 second increments, stirring after each, until melted. Evenly divide the glaze among 6 small bowls. Color one purple, one royal blue, one sky blue, one green, one yellow, one orange and one red. Allow the glaze to thicken slightly. Create a melting rainbow by pouring colored glaze down the side of the cake, starting with the purple, then royal blue, sky blue, green, yellow, orange and red. Set the cake on a serving dish so you know which end has the numbers facing forward. Cut into the cake and reveal the surprise hiding inside.",

    "instructions": "For the cookies: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter 2 baking sheets.\nPlace the butter and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer equipped with the paddle attachment-the one that looks like the peace sign-and beat until creamy and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the egg yolks and almond extract and beat for another minute or so, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally.\nIn another large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and chopped almonds.\nGradually add the flour mixture to the butter-sugar mixture. When combined, the dough should be soft and homogeneous. Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, until firm.\nWhen you're ready to bake, take the dough out of the fridge and roll it into 3/4-inch balls. Place the balls about 1 inch apart on a prepared baking sheet. Using the tip of your thumb, make a hole as deep as you can in each doughball without actually poking through the bottom. Roll your thumb around a little bit to widen the hole-this is your thumbprint!\nBake the cookies for 16 to 18 minutes or until they begin to turn golden around the edges. Remove from the oven and cool. While the cookies are cooling, repoke each one with your thumb to create a really nice spot for the caramel. Repeat with the remaining dough.\nFor the caramel: In a medium saute pan, combine the sugar, lemon juice, corn syrup, and 1/4 cup water. Bring the pan to medium-high heat. Be careful not to swish the pan around as that can cause the sugar to recrystallize. As the mixture boils, the water will evaporate and the sugar will begin to turn brown, or \"caramelize.\" This is the point when you DO NOT want to take your eyes off it! Things can take a turn for the worse here and there will be no recovery. As the sugar begins to turn gold and move toward golden brown, remove it from the heat and add the heavy cream. As you do this it will bubble up like crazy. Be sure to use a pan large enough to accommodate the bubbling-this stuff is molten and can cause a very severe burn. Whisk the cream until things settle down and the bubbles subside, then add the butter 2 pats at a time, making sure each addition is thoroughly incorporated before adding more.\nLet the caramel cool slightly, then spoon it into the hole of each cookie and let cool. You'll most likely have leftover caramel sauce, so save it for something yummy-like pouring over vanilla ice cream!",

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nUsing a sharp thin knife, cut a slit into the flesh side of the veal chop almost to the bone. With your hand placing pressure on the top of the chop, move the knife in a slicing motion to form a 3-inch pocket in the chop. Cover the chop with a piece of plastic wrap. Using the flat side of a meat mallet or a small heavy skillet, gently pound the chop until it is about 1/3 inch thick. Remove the plastic wrap and discard. Stuff one piece of the fontina cheese into the pocket and close the meat around it. On one side of the chop, place 3 small sage leaves on the meat. Cover the sage leaves with 2 pieces of cheese and follow that with 2 pieces of prosciutto. Turn over the chop and repeat on the other side.\nPlace the flour, eggs and breadcrumbs in 3 separate shallow dishes and season each of them with 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Season the flour with the pepper. Dredge both sides of the prosciutto-wrapped veal chop in the flour and shake off the excess. Then place the chop into the egg, followed by the panko, packing the breadcrumbs on to the chop to help them stick.\nIn a medium skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat until hot. Add the breaded chop and cook until the breadcrumbs on the first side are golden brown, about 2 minutes.

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nThis looks like a lot of work, but it really isn't. All you have to do is set yourself up for success! First, line a baking sheet with paper towels or parchment paper. Set a cooling rack over it. This will be where you land your fried 'maters.\nThen, using your hands, rip the burrata into bite-size pieces (1 per slice of tomatillo), and line them up on a plate. Season them with a little salt and pepper. Slice your lime into wedges so that it's easy to squeeze over the top of the whole thing at the end; keep your basil handy too. Set them aside.\nTo make the cumin oil: In a very small skillet (cast-iron if you have it), warm the olive oil until it's nearly smoking. Add the cumin seeds. (The seeds should sizzle once they hit that oil! If not, your oil is not hot enough.)\nCook, swirling the pan every now and then, until the cumin seeds darken in colour (don't let them burn!). As soon as they've darkened, pour the oil into a small bowl, and let it cool.\nThen, grab a large skillet (again cast-iron is awesome) and set it over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil. Keep an eye on it while you set up your dredging station (if it starts to smoke, take it off the heat to cool off).\nPour the buttermilk into a flat-bottomed dish, and season with a little salt and pepper. In another similarly shaped bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, garam masala, and cayenne pepper. Season it also with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.\nTo check that the oil is hot, drop a pinch of the flour-cornmeal mixture into the pan. If it sizzles enthusiastically at you, it's time to go!\nDip both sides of a tomatillo slice in the buttermilk. Then, using your other hand (to avoid the \"claw\"), dredge it in the cornmeal mixture. Shake off excess cornmeal, and drop it into the oil. Repeat with as many slices as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding. By the time you've placed the last slice in the pan, it will probably be time to flip the first one. It should be lightly golden, but not soft. Cook another minute or so, and then remove to the parchment-lined baking sheet.\nTo assemble: Place the tomatillos on a platter. Top each one with a piece of burrata. Drizzle those puppies with a little cumin-infused oil. Sprinkle some basil over the top and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. Serve your fancy-pants fried green beauties immediately!\nCombine the cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, green cardamom pods, and black cardamom pods into a spice/coffee grinder and grind until fine. Store the masala in an airtight container away from direct sunlight.",

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.\nMelt the butter in a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat. Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the butter browns lightly and smells slightly nutty, about 15 minutes. Transfer the butter to a medium bowl -- be sure to get all the tasty brown bits -- and cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt in another medium bowl.\nWhisk the egg yolk, sugar and vanilla into the cooled browned butter.\nStir the dry ingredients into the butter mixture to make a uniform but crumbly dough that looks like wet sand.\nScoop out dough with a small teaspoon (the kind you set the table with, not the ones you measure with). Rock spoon gently back and forth against the side of the bowl, packing the dough into the spoon, then scrape/slide the spoon against the inside of the bowl to make spoon-shaped cookies. Trim excess dough with your fingers and slide out onto the prepared pans, preserving their shape. (Try to make sure you form an even number of cookies, since these sandwich together.)\nBake cookies until just browned, about 12 to 15 minutes. Cool almost completely on the baking sheets, and then transfer cookies to a rack to cool.\nWhen cool, spread 1/2 teaspoon jam on the flat side of a cookie, and then sandwich together with a second cookie. Repeat until all cookies have met their match. Lightly dust the cookies with the confectioners' sugar. Serve.\nBusy baker's tips: The dough can be prepared several hours ahead and stored at room temperature. Freeze baked cookie halves wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, followed by aluminum foil for up to 2 weeks. When ready to serve, defrost at room temperature and assemble as desired. Store sandwiches in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Do not store with crisp cookies, as moisture from the jam will soften the texture of other crisp cookies.\nCopyright (c) 2007 Television Food Network, G.P., All Rights Reserved",

In a heavy-bottomed roasting pan over medium-high heat, heat olive oil on stove top. Carefully place the osso bucco in the hot roasting pan and sear all sides, until nicely browned. Once seared on all sides, remove from pan and set back onto plate. Using the same pot with the lamb drippings in the bottom, add carrots, celery, onions, and garlic. Saute for approximately 10 minutes using a wooden spoon to scrape the lamb drippings off the bottom of the pan and to caramelize the vegetables. Once caramelized, add tomato paste, coat the vegetables with the paste, and brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the drippings off the bottom of pan using a wooden spoon. Reduce the wine by half and add the Lamb Stock and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Place the seared osso bucco back into the pan. Change to high heat and once the stock starts to boil, put roasting pan into the oven. Cook the osso bucco for about 2 hours until it is fork tender, almost falling off the bone.

If you are using powdered chipotle, add onions and mushrooms first then season with the powder. Cook the mushrooms and onions, stirring frequently, 10 minutes. Do not add salt and pepper ¿ the salt will draw liquid out of the mushrooms, slowing up the browning process.\nHeat a heavy bottomed pan and sear the steaks for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side for medium rare to medium. Add 2 minutes for medium to medium well doneness. Once cooked, let meat rest 5 or 10 minutes for juice to redistribute.\nOnce the mushrooms are tender, coarsely chop the spinach and fold into the pan in bunches until wilted and incorporated fully. Season the mixture with salt and pepper and remove from heat.\nChar bread under broiler, rub it with the remaining clove of garlic, butter the bread and sprinkle with chives.

Grab a ladle of the hot half-and-half mixture and drizzle it very slowly into the yolks, whisking constantly. This will temper the egg yolks so that they don't scramble when they're added to the pan.

Lay the unpeeled garlic on the hot surface and let it roast to a sweet mellowness, turning occasionally, until soft when pressed between your fingers (you'll notice it has blackened in a few small spots), about 15 minutes. Cool, then slip off the papery skins and roughly chop.\nWhile the garlic is roasting, break the stems of the chiles, tear the chiles open and remove the seeds. Next, toast the chiles a few at a time on you medium-hot skillet or griddle: Open them flat, lay them on the hot surface skin-side up, press flat for a few seconds with a metal spatula (if the temperature is right you'll hear a faint crackle), then flip them. (If pressed long enough, they'll have changed to a mottled tan underneath. If you see a slight wisp of smoke, that's okay, but any more will mean burnt chiles.) Now, press down again to toast the other side. Transfer to a bowl, cover with hot water and let rehydrate for 30 minutes, stirring regularly to ensure even soaking. Pour off all the water and discard.\nThe seasoning: If using whole spices, pulverise the oregano, pepper, cumin and cloves in a spice grinder or mortar, then transfer to a food processor or blender, along with the drained chiles and garlic. Measure in the broth and process to a smooth puree, scraping and stirring every few seconds. (If you're using a blender and the mixture won't move through the blades, add more broth, a little at a time, until everything is moving, but still as thick as possible.)

When the pancetta has started to get brown and crispy add the onions. Season with salt and crushed red pepper and sweat over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, season with salt and saute for 3 to 4 minutes or until they release their juices. Add the wine and reduce by half. Return the chicken to the pan. Add chicken stock to almost cover the chicken. Add the thyme and bay leaves. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer the chicken for 30 to 35 minutes. Add more chicken stock, if needed.\nWhile the chicken is cooking puree the almonds in the food processor. Drizzle in a little olive oil while the machine is running to make this a loose paste. Season with salt and reserve.\nOnce the chicken has cooked for 30 to 35 minutes, remove it from the pan and reserve. Taste the sauce for seasoning and stir in the almond puree. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer to thicken the sauce, if needed. The almond puree will help to thicken the sauce and to make it very rich.\nServe the chicken over Sauteed Haricots Verts or your favorite green vegetable. Spoon the mushroom almond sauce over and garnish with chopped chives.\nBring a large pot of well salted water to a boil. Set up a bowl of well salted ice water for shocking.\nAdd the beans to the boiling water and cook until the beans are tender but still toothsome about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the boiling water and place immediately into the salted ice water. Once the beans are cool, remove them from the water and set aside until ready to use.\nCoat a large saute pan with olive oil. Add the garlic and the crushed red pepper and bring to a medium-high heat. When the garlic has become golden and very aromatic, remove it and discard. It has fulfilled its garlic destiny. Add the beans to the pan and saute until they are hot and coated with oil. Season with salt and serve right away.\nYield: 4 servings\nPrep time: 10 minutes\nCook time: 10 minutes",

Brush the center of each pizza to within 1 inch of the edge with olive oil and sprinkle it with some of the red onion. Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake 8 to 12 minutes or until crust is golden brown. Remember that the oven is very hot and be careful as you place the pizza into and out of the oven.\nMix the dill with the sour cream or creme fraiche and freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer the pizzas to heated dinner plates and spread them with the sour cream mixture.\nDivide the salmon, and arrange decoratively over the cream. Place a spoonful of golden caviar in the center of each pizza, then spoon a little of the black caviar into the center of the golden caviar.\nPizza Dough:\n1 package active dry or fresh yeast\n1 teaspoon honey\n1 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus additional for brushing\nIn a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and honey in 1/4-cup warm water.\nIn a mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the flour and the salt. Add the oil, yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 cup of water and mix on low speed until the dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. (The pizza dough can also be made in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Pulse once or twice, add the remaining ingredients, and process until the dough begins to form a ball).\nTurn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes longer. The dough should be smooth and firm. Cover the dough with a clean, damp towel and let it rise in a warm spot for about 30 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled).\nDivide the dough into 4 balls, about 6 ounces each. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Then on a smooth, unfloured surface, roll the ball under the palm of your hand until the top of the dough is smooth and firm, about 1 minute. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.\nTo prepare each pizza, dip the ball of dough into flour, shake off the excess flour, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface, and start to stretch the dough. Press down on the center, spreading the dough into an 8-inch circle, with the outer border a little thicker than the inner circle.

    "instructions": "Prepare the Simple Pizza Dough according to recipe.\nPreheat the oven to 500 degrees F.\nOn a baking sheet brushed liberally with olive oil, stretch the dough to desired shape and thickness. Brush the crust with olive oil and top with the mozzarella slices. Bake the pizza until the dough crisps up and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.\nRemove the pizza from oven. Top the melted mozzarella with the grated Parmesan and sliced chicken. Toss the romaine hearts with the Caesar Salad Dressing and season with salt and pepper. Top the pizza with the Caesar salad and shave over some Parmesan. Serve and enjoy!\nCook's Note: If you don't have a pizza stone at home, no worries, use a well-oiled sheet tray and a hot oven to achieve a crisp bottom on your pizza! Also place the dough on the very bottom rack of your oven. It will help to create that crispy crust.\nIn a blender or food processor, process the Parmesan, mayonnaise, lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, Worcestershire, salt, pepper, garlic and anchovy until emulsified and smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.;\nIn a liquid measuring cup, combine the warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow the yeast to dissolve and bloom, about 5 minutes. Once bloomed, add the olive oil.\nMeanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the flour and salt. Stream in the water/yeast mixture and as the dough begins to come together, switch to a dough hook attachment. Allow the dough to knead, adding a bit more flour if needed, so that the dough releases from the sides of the bowl, 1 to 3 minutes. You should be able to touch the dough and not have the dough stick to your fingers. Once the dough has kneaded and has pulled away from the sides of the bowl, remove the dough from bowl to a floured work surface and, with floured hands, continue to knead it by hand for 1 to 2 minutes. Then form the dough into a round ball and place it into a large bowl sprayed with nonstick spray. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let the dough rise in a warm area of your kitchen until it doubles in size, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. After the dough has risen it is ready to be cooked however you'd like!\nCook's Notes: This dough is wet dough, keep bench flour at the ready and make sure to flour your hands when working with the dough. Trust your gut as a chef, if the dough is to wet, add more flour, if it is too stiff, add a little water.\nSugar is used to feed the yeast which will help the dough to grow. Bread flour will give you a chewier texture because the flour has more gluten. You don't need to use a thermometer to get the water temperature, it should just feel warm to the touch.",

    "instructions": "Use an electric fryer or a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan placed over medium-high heat to heat the oil to 330 degrees F. It is important to maintain the temperature, so you may need to adjust the heat or remove the pan from the burner to keep it where you want it.\nPrepare the pate a choux: Place the water, salt, granulated sugar, zests, and butter in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. The butter should be completely melted by the time the mixture boils. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the bread flour all at once and incorporate it thoroughly with a wooden spoon.\nReturn the saucepan to the stove and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes to dry out the paste. As it cooks, push the paste from side to side with the wooden spoon. Turn it onto itself to allow every side to touch the bottom of the saucepan, which helps it dry. Keep the paste moving, or it will burn. The paste will dry out and leave a thin film on the bottom of the saucepan.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the paste to a large mixing bowl. Mix with an electric mixer on low speed for about 2 minutes to release some of the steam. Continue mixing and slowly add the eggs 1 at a time, incorporating well after each addition. After each egg is added, the paste will become loose and look separated. Once each egg is well incorporated, the paste will become smooth again. The number of eggs used will vary depending on the size of the eggs and how well the pate a choux is dried. The drier it is, the more eggs you will need. After you have added 2 eggs, check the consistency by scooping a large amount of the paste onto a wooden spoon. Hold the spoon horizontally about 1 foot above the bowl and watch as the batter falls from the spoon back into the bowl. If it is pale yellow, smooth, moist, slightly elastic, sticky, and takes 5 to 7 seconds to fall into the bowl, it is ready. If it appears rough, dry, and falls into the bowl in 1 big ball, it needs more eggs. Add another egg and check the consistency again after it is well incorporated.\nPrepare the cloud puffs: Cut a piece of parchment paper the same diameter as the pan of cooking oil. Place the pate a choux in a piping bag fitted with a plain tip. Pipe the mixture onto the parchment paper. In small 3/4-inch dabs about 1/2-inch apart. To fry, take your fully piped round of parchment and flip it over into the hot oil. Be careful not to splatter the hot oil. The parchment will sit on the surface of the oil and as the puffs fry, they will release themselves from the paper. Once this happens remove the parchment from the oil and continue to fry the puffs until they are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn them over to evenly fry each side. They will increase in size as they cook. Use a large slotted spoon or spider to remove the puffs from the hot oil and set them on a paper towel to drain.\nWhile the puffs are still warm, sprinkle them with granulated sugar until evenly coated. Dust them with the powdered sugar just before serving. They are best served immediately, as they tend to get soggy after a few hours. Jacques' tip: If your oil is too hot, add a small amount of cold oil to lower the temperature.",

Salt the eggplant and let it drain on a kitchen towel for 20 minutes.\nPlace the mint and 1 cup of the basil leaves with the toasted pine nuts in the bowl of a food processor. Season with salt and pepper and grate in 1 clove garlic. Add in the lemon zest and juice, then turn the processor on and stream in about 1/4 cup olive oil. Place the pesto in a large shallow bowl that you can serve the zucchini pasta from. Stir in the cheese.\nUsing a vegetable peeler and shaving the length of the zucchinis very thinly slice them into wide, pasta-like ribbons. If the zucchini are large and seedy, discard the seeds once you get to the center. Flip the zucchini over and peel until you reach seeds. If the zucchini are firm and small to medium in size you'll be able to use all of the vegetable.\nPlace the vegetable stock and 2 cups water in deep skillet.\nHeat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil, 3 turns of the pan, in a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant to the hot oil and lightly brown, 6 to 7 minutes, tossing occasionally. Toss and combine with the chile flakes and remaining garlic. Add the tomatoes and cover the pan with a tight fitting lid. Shake the pan occasionally and cook until the tomatoes burst, 7 to 8 minutes more.\nMeanwhile, heat the stock and water to low rolling boil, add the zucchini, cook 2 minutes. Use a spider or tongs to remove the zucchini to the pesto. Add 1 cup cooking liquids and toss to coat and combine, using additional cooking liquids if necessary. Top with extra cheese to serve.\nRemove the lid from the eggplant and tear in the remaining 1/2 cup basil leaves. Toss to combine.\nServe the zucchini piled up on plate with the eggplant alongside, topping eggplant with crumbled ricotta salata.",

    "instructions": "To make the eclairs: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\nThere are several ways to shape your bubble eclairs. Usually I portion the dough with a small cookie scoop (one with a capacity of 2 teaspoons), but you can pipe the dough from a pastry bag with a plain or open star tip, which makes squiggles and swirls that look lovely when baked. You might want to make it simple and just use a zipper-lock plastic bag as a piping bag.\nNo matter what you use, you want to scoop or pipe 3 balls of dough as close to one another as you can get them for each eclair. If you're scooping, scoop 1 ball, then crowd it with the second-giving it a little nudge-and then scoop out the last bubble, snuggling it up to the second ball of dough. When you've got 3 bubbles in a row, move on to the next eclair, making sure to leave at least 2 inches of puff-and-grow space between the clusters. If you're piping, the principle is the same.\nNow you have to make some decisions about the topping. If you're going to top the bubbles with disks of crackle, there's no need to give them an egg wash. Just lay a circle of the Crackle Top Dough on each puff of dough.\nIf you'd like to top the eclairs with Streusel or pearl sugar, then it's nice to give each puff a swipe of egg wash. Make an effort to keep the egg wash on the top of the puffs and not let it drip down the sides; it's not fatal, but it does hamper the even rise of the pate a choux. If you're using Streusel, break up the pieces with your fingertips and use a smidge on each puff-put it on and press it down very, very lightly. If you're using pearl sugar, go to town-it's nice to have that crunch.\nSlide the baking sheet into the oven and immediately turn the oven temperature down to 375 degrees F. Bake the eclairs for 20 minutes without opening the oven door, then rotate the pan and continue to bake the pastries for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden on top and bottom and firm to the touch. Transfer the eclairs to a rack to cool to room temperature.\nTo fill the eclairs: There are two traditional ways to fill eclairs, both good and both fun. One is to fill a pastry bag with whatever you've chosen as a filling, use a medium plain pastry tip to poke a hole in the eclair-either in the bottom or in one side-nuzzle the tip into the hole and squeeze in enough filling to come to the edges of the hole.\nThe other way is to slice the eclairs horizontally, either in half or by cutting off the top one third. If you do this, you can scoop out the (inevitable) eggy innards. Some people love the custard interior, some don't, so know thyself (and thine audience). Pipe, spoon or scoop the filling into the bottom of the eclairs and cap with the tops.\nNo matter how you've filled the pastries, they should be served immediately or stowed in the refrigerator until needed.\nIf you haven't sugared or crackled your eclairs, you might want to give them a last-minute dusting of confectioners' sugar.\nServing: There's no law that says you can't pass these around and let everyone eat them out of hand, but I think of them as knife-and-fork pastries. If you serve them with cutlery you might want to serve them with bittersweet chocolate sauce or hot or cold salted caramel sauce.\nBring the milk, water, butter, sugar and salt to a rapid boil in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over high heat. Add the flour all at once, lower the heat to medium-low and quickly start stirring energetically with a wooden spoon or sturdy heatproof spatula. The dough will come together and a light crust will form on the bottom of the pan. Keep stirring vigorously for another minute or two to dry the dough. The dough should be very smooth.\nTurn the dough out into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or into a large bowl in which you can use a hand mixer or a wooden spoon. Let the dough sit for 3 minutes, then add the eggs one by one, beating until the dough is thick and shiny. Make sure that each egg is fully incorporated before you add the next, and don't be concerned if the dough falls apart; by the time the last egg goes in, it will have come together again. The dough should be used immediately.\nRemove the butter from the refrigerator 10 minutes before you're ready to make the dough.\nAfter 10 minutes, cut the butter into small cubes and toss it and the brown sugar and salt into a food processor. Process until almost blended. Add the flour and pulse until the dough forms moist curds. Pulse in the vanilla.\nScrape the dough onto a piece of parchment or wax paper and shape it into a disk. Cover with another piece of parchment or wax paper and roll the dough out so that it's about 1/16th inch thick. Slide the dough, still between the paper, onto a cutting board and freeze it for at least 2 hours. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months, in which case it should be wrapped airtight.)\nPut the flour, sugar and salt in a medium bowl and mix everything together by running the ingredients through your fingers. Drop in the butter and squeeze and rub the cubes into the mixture until you have a sandy mix. If you press a little streusel together, you'll get lumps, which is just what you want. Drizzle the vanilla over the streusel and toss, squeeze and rub to distribute it. Cover the bowl and chill the streusel until needed. (You can make the streusel up to 1 week ahead; pack it in an airtight container and keep it refrigerated.)\nIf using a vanilla bean, cut it in half lengthwise and use the tip of the knife to scrape out the pulpy seeds. Bring the milk and vanilla bean pulp and pod to a boil in a medium saucepan. (If you're using extract, you'll add it later.) Cover the pan, turn off the heat and let infuse for at least 10 minutes, or for up to 1 hour.\nReturn the milk to a boil if you've used a vanilla bean; bring it to a boil if you're using extract.\nWhisk the yolks, sugar and cornstarch together in a medium heatproof bowl until blended. Whisking constantly, drizzle in one quarter of the hot milk to temper, or warm, the yolks. Still whisking, add the remainder of the liquid in a steady stream. Remove the pod (if you have it), pour the mixture into the saucepan and, whisking vigorously and constantly, bring to a boil over medium heat. Keep at a boil-never stop whisking-for 1 to 2 minutes, then press the cream through a sieve into a clean bowl. Stir in the vanilla extract, if you're using it.\nLeave the pastry cream on the counter for 10 minutes, then whisk in the butter until it is fully incorporated and the pastry cream is smooth and silky.\nEither press a piece of plastic film against the surface of the cream and refrigerate it until it's thoroughly chilled, at least 2 hours, or fill a large bowl with ice cubes and cold water, set the bowl of pastry cream in it and leave the cream there, stirring occasionally, until it's cold. Use now, or cover and refrigerate until needed.\nStoring: The pastry cream can be kept tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Whisk it well to loosen it before using.\nWorking in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a hand mixer or a balloon whip, beat the cream and 1 to 2 tablespoons sugar together just until the cream starts to thicken. Taste and add more sugar, if you'd like, then continue to beat until you get the thickness you want. I use my stand mixer and start off slow, then increase the speed and when the cream is almost whipped the way I want it, I finish it by hand with a whisk. Hand finishing reduces the risk of overbeating and turning your cream into sweetened butter. When the cream is just right, stir in the vanilla extract, if you're using it.\nStoring: Whipped cream is best served soon after it's made, but it will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for a few hours. Give it a go-round with a whisk just before serving. To keep the cream longer- or to get a thicker cream- line a strainer with a piece of moistened cheesecloth, place the strainer over a bowl and put the cream in the strainer. Wrap the whole setup in plastic film and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.\nWorking in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, or in a large bowl with a heavy-duty hand mixer, beat the cream until it holds medium-firm peaks. If you're working in a stand mixer, transfer the cream to another bowl and rinse and dry the mixer bowl and whisk. Cover the whipped cream and refrigerate.\nPut the eggs and yolks in the mixer bowl and fit the machine with the whisk attachment, or work in another large bowl with the hand mixer. Beat the eggs at low speed just to break them up. Set aside while you prepare the chocolate and syrup.\nMelt the chocolate in a microwave oven or in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water, making sure that the heat isn't too high and that the chocolate remains thick and shiny. If necessary, scrape the chocolate into a bowl that's large enough to hold all the ingredients for the mousse; set aside. The chocolate must cool (114 degrees F is the ideal temperature) so that when you fold in the cold whipped cream, it doesn't seize and clump.\nBring the sugar and water to a boil in a small heavy-bottomed saucepan. Swirl the pan to mix the ingredients as they start to heat, and if some of the sugar spatters on the sides of the pan, wash it down with a silicone pastry brush dipped in cold water. Cook the sugar over high heat until it reaches 257 degrees F on a candy or instant-read thermometer, about 8 minutes (or maybe a little more, depending on the dimensions of your pan and the heat you have under it).\nBack to the eggs: Beat the eggs on the lowest speed, just to get them moving again, then very slowly pour in the hot sugar syrup in a thin stream. Try to pour the syrup between the side of the bowl and the whirring whisk. Please be careful-this is soooooooo hot and sticky! No matter how careful you are, you'll get spatters and you should just leave them-trying to scrape them into the eggs will only produce lumps. When all the syrup is in the bowl, up the mixer speed to high and beat until the eggs are pale and more than doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. If the eggs have doubled but still feel warm, lower the mixer speed to medium and keep beating until they reach room temperature.\nPull the whipped cream from the refrigerator and give it a couple of rounds with a whisk, just to bring back the medium-firm peaks. Working with a large flexible spatula, fold about one quarter of the whipped cream into the chocolate to lighten it, then gently fold in the rest of the cream. Now, using the spatula and your lightest touch, fold in the whipped eggs. Your voluminous eggs will deflate some, but be gentle and the texture of your mousse will be lovely.\nUse the mousse now if you're filling a cake with it, but if you want to pipe it, it's best to cover and chill it for at least 1 hour. And if you are serving it on its own, chill it.\nServing: The mousse can be served elegantly in small cups or bowls, topped with a rosette of unsweetened whipped cream, or family style, as it's often served in French homes.\nStoring: The mousse can be covered tightly and kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.",

Cook the syrup until it reaches 250 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Add the toasted pistachios to the hot syrup and stir until the nuts are well coated. When all the sugar coats the pistachios and any remaining syrup turns powdery white, pour the nuts onto a baking sheet to cool.\nOnce cooled, place the pistachios in the bowl of a food processor with the almond flour.

Try and turn the bucatini around the rabbit to make a nest (it won't completely stay in place), sprinkle chopped parsley on top, and finish with a drizzle of olive oil.\nTo make the dough:\nPut the flour in a mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and break the eggs and yolks in the middle. Add the olive oil to the well and beat with a fork to incorporate the olive oil with the eggs. Slowly begin to assimilate flour until you have a thick paste and can begin working with your fingers and assimilate the rest. Put the dough on a lightly floured countertop and knead for a few minutes until the dough is elastic. Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nTo finish:\nBring a large pot filled with salted water to a boil. Drop the pasta in the water and cook until the bucatini is al dente (try one to check), 2 to 4 minutes. Put the butter and sage in a saute pan set over medium heat and let the butter solids turn brown. Add the bucatini to the pan along with a little pasta cooking water (this stops the butter from browning) and keep moving the pasta gently in the pan until the water evaporates. Add the cheese. Serve with the sage leaves, if you like.\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\nArrange the mushrooms in a baking dish. Melt the butter with the sage and garlic in a small pan set over medium heat. When the butter solids have turned a nutty blond, pour the butter (discard the garlic and sage) over the mushrooms. Season with salt and pepper and roast, turning occasionally, until the mushrooms are tender but still slightly al dente, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer them to a bowl, toss with the parsley, drizzle with olive oil, and keep warm.\nMelt the fontina in a microwave oven on high heat, cooking for 1 minute intervals, until the cheese is runny. Pour into a pastry bag and immediately roll out the bucatini dough. If the cheese hardens in the meantime, you can reheat it in the microwave for a few seconds, but only if the bag has a plastic (not metal) tip.\nRoll out the bucatini dough using a pasta machine, always dusting the pasta sheet with flour to prevent sticking, until the sheet is 1/32-inch thick (or slightly thinner, if you can).\nCut the pasta sheet crosswise into strips 2 1/2 to 3-inches wide (and about 4-inches long). Brush the strips with egg white and squeeze out a rope of fontina stuffing down the length of the strip, stopping 1/4-inch from each end. Roll the pasta strip over the stuffing until you have a tightly stuffed cylinder. The pasta should roll over itself twice. Pinch the ends closed and then cut off the pinched part to seal the bucatini. Make at least 24 bucatini.",

On each rectangle, lay 4 green bean halves crosswise (the tips should poke out a little) and top with about 1 teaspoon of the cheese; roll the rectangle up, making sure the ends overlap; and seal and arrange, seam-side down, 2 inches apart on a prepared baking sheet. Brush each with egg, and sprinkle with caraway seeds.\nBake until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes.\nMeanwhile, mix together the mustard and sour cream in a small bowl. Serve on the side as a dipping sauce.",

    "instructions": "For the filling: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss the butternut squash with some olive oil and salt. Place onto a baking sheet and into the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.\nPut a saute pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Add the apples and salt to taste, and saute until softened. Hit it with the brown sugar and toss until melted. Hit it with the bourbon off the flame, and then carefully tip the pan to the flame to flambe and let the alcohol burn off. Add the apple cider and bring back to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until glazy and delicious, about 10 minutes. Toss in the roasted butternut squash and half of the chopped walnuts.\nTo assemble: Add about 1/4 cup of the filling into the bottom third of a crepe. Roll the crepe and place seam-side down on a plate. Repeat this process with the remaining ingredients.\nTo serve: Arrange 1 crepe roll on each serving plate and spoon more butternut squash and apple filling over the top. Garnish with toasted walnuts and serve with Cinnamon Gelato. Dust with powdered sugar.\nFor the batter: In a mixing bowl, add the flour and salt and make a well in the center. Add the eggs, milk and club soda into the center of the well and whisk together until just combined. The mixture should be like VERY loose pancake batter. If the mixture is a little thick, whisk in a little more milk. Let the batter sit for at least 30 minutes before using. The crepe batter can be made up to 2 days in advance, covered and refrigerated.\nFor the crepes: Melt about 1/2 teaspoon of the butter in a small nonstick saute pan. The butter should coat the bottom of the pan; if there is a lot of excess, wipe it out with a paper towel. Keep the paper towel handy in case you need it again (you will).\nPut the pan over medium heat. Fill a 2-ounce ladle almost to the top with batter and pour it into the preheated pan, tipping and rolling the pan as you ladle the batter to evenly cover the bottom. This will take a little practice; even when you are an experienced crepe maker, the first couple always get wasted. Accept it and move on.\nWhen the edges of the crepe begin to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bottom begins to brown a little, flip the crepe over and cook it for about 1 minute on the other side. Remove the crepe from the pan to a plate and let cool. Stack the crepes as they are cooked between parchment paper squares.\nRepeat this process until all the batter is used, wiping the pan with your paper towel or melting a little more butter to the pan as needed.\nIn a medium saucepan, combine the heavy cream, 1/4 cup of the sugar, the vanilla extract, salt and cinnamon sticks. Bring to a boil, turn off the heat and let sit.\nIn a small bowl, combine the egg yolks and the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and beat to a homogeneous consistency.\nBring the heavy cream-cinnamon mixture back to a boil and turn the heat off. Whisk a third of the heavy cream mixture into the egg-sugar mixture, and then immediately whisk the egg mixture back into the remaining heavy cream mixture. Bring the mixture back up over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 10 minutes. Strain the mixture and chill over an ice water bath.\nChurn the chilled mixture in an ice cream/gelato machine according to the manufacturer's directions.",

    "instructions": "To prepare the puddings, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Brush the inside of six 6-ounce heat-proof custard cups or ramekins with the melted butter. Invert the custard cups on a baking sheet and refrigerate until the butter sets.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with a handheld mixer), beat the 8 tablespoons butter and the cane sugar on high speed until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the yolk and the vanilla, beating well and scraping down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula after each addition. Beat in the pumpkin puree and scrape down the bowl.\nAdd the flour mixture in thirds, alternating with the buttermilk, beating each time only until the batter is smooth.\nUse an ice cream scoop or large spoon to carefully divide the batter among the custard cups, taking care to keep the rims clean. Gently tap each cup to remove any air bubbles.\nIn a lidded baking dish or Dutch oven large enough to hold the custard cups with at least 1/2 inch of space between them, place a folded kitchen towel (to hold the cups steady). Arrange the custard cups in the dish. Pour enough very hot tap water into the baking dish to come halfway up the sides of the cups. Cover the baking dish tightly with the lid.\nBake until a toothpick inserted into the center of a pudding comes out clean and the top springs back when gently pressed, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the lid and let the puddings cool in the water bath for 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare the hard sauce. In a medium bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer set to high speed until fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners' sugar. When the sugar is incorporated, increase the speed to high, and beat until the mixture is light and fluffy.\nFold in the nutmeg and rum with a rubber spatula; you should have about 1/2 cup. Use within 1 hour or transfer to a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week. Allow the sauce to come to room temperature before serving.\nThe puddings can be served warm or at room temperature. If serving directly in the custard cups, serve at once or let cool on a wire rack. If unmolding, to serve the puddings warm as soon as they come out of the water, run a thin knife around the inside of each ramekin to loosen the puddings, then invert into a serving plate. To serve at room temperature, place the ramekins on a wire rack until the puddings cool before inverting them onto serving plates. Top each serving with about 1 tablespoon of the hard sauce and a large shard of brittle.\nGenerously butter a rimmed baking sheet or line it with a silicone baking mat. In a large skillet, cook the pumpkin seeds over medium heat, stirring often, until they are lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate to cool.\nIn a large, heavy, deep saucepan, combine the cane sugar, corn syrup, 1/4 cup water, and 2 tablespoons butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring with a long-handled wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat to medium high, and bring the mixture to a boil. Let the mixture boil without stirring until it turns deep amber, 8 to 12 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat and carefully stir in the baking soda, vanilla, and salt. The mixture will bubble vigorously and expand in the pan. Immediately stir in the pumpkin seeds and pour onto the prepared baking sheet. Use a heat-proof spatula to gently but quickly spread the brittle into a thin, even layer.\nLet the brittle cool to room temperature. Run an offset spatula under the brittle to help loosen it, or gently twist the pan. Break the brittle into shards. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.",

    "instructions": "Watch how to make this recipe.\nSpecial equipment: butcher's twine\nIn a mortar and pestle, combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, sage, fennel seeds, thyme, rosemary, 1 tablespoon black pepper, chile flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Grind and pound the mixture into a smooth paste. Place the turkey breast skin side down on a clean flat surface. With a sharp knife, butterfly the turkey by cutting down the long side of the breast so it can open up like a book to create a large, flat rectangle of even thickness. Score the flesh lightly in a cross-hatch pattern, being careful not to cut too deeply into the flesh. Season the turkey with salt and black pepper. Rub the herb-spice paste into all the cuts on the surface of the turkey breast. Roll the butterflied breast together tightly starting with the side that does not have skin underneath it (that way there is skin on the outer layers when rolling it up). Form the turkey into a cylinder and secure with butcher¿s twine. Tie the roll every 1 1/2 inches, then place in the refrigerator for 4 hours uncovered; this will help the turkey firm up and allows the salt to do a short dry cure on the meat.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nRemove the turchetta from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature, about 30 minutes. Brush the turchetta with olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. In a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, brown the turchetta, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Arrange the turchetta skin side up and place the whole pan into the oven and cook until the internal temperature reaches 150 degrees F (carryover cooking will increase the temperature as the turchetta rests), about 1 hour 30 minutes. Remove from the oven, place on a large plate, tent with foil and rest 15 to 20 minutes. Add the chicken stock to the reserved juices in the pan and stir to combine. Keep warm.\nTo serve the turchetta, remove the string and use a sharp carving knife to slice it into 1-inch-thick medallions. Shingle the slices on a large serving platter, spoon cooking juice over the turchetta, and serve immediately.",

    "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.\nPrepare the hens: In a mini food processor, pulse the garlic and 1 teaspoon salt to a paste. Using your fingers, make a pocket between the flesh and the skin of each Cornish hen. Stuff half the garlic paste between the skin and the flesh of the hens, evenly covering by pushing the paste along the flesh from the outside. Rub both hens all over with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and a grind of pepper. Cross the legs of each hen and tie together with kitchen string. Set aside and allow to come to room temperature for about an hour.\nIn a baking dish large enough to hold both hens, mix together the remaining garlic paste, the bell pepper, onions, cayenne pepper, paprika, a pinch of salt and a grind or 2 of pepper.\nPlace the prepared hens on top of the vegetables in the pan and slowly pour in 2 cups chicken stock. Place in the oven and cook until the temperature reaches 160 degrees F between the leg and the body of the hen when tested with an instant-read thermometer, about 40 minutes.\nRemove the hens from oven and remove from the pan to a plate. Cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep them warm while making the gravy. In a medium saute pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the vegetables from the baking dish and the flour. Whisk the flour briskly until it is combined with all the pan contents. Add the wine and let reduce. Take a sip of wine for yourself; you've worked hard. Stir in the remaining 1 cup chicken stock. Taste and season with salt and pepper, and then cook until the sauce has thickened to a gravy consistency, about 5 more minutes. To serve, remove the aluminum foil from the hens. Remove the string and cut in the birds in half. Pour the gravy over the top and garnish with chopped parsley.",

Drain the frisee and fennel and dry in a salad spinner. Set the frisee and fennel aside in a medium bowl.\nTo the same bowl add the reserved bacon, pickled onions, and warm vinaigrette dressing that has been spooned around the side of the bowl. Spooning the dressing on the side of the bowl helps from overdressing the salad itself. Toss to combine.\nFor the poached egg: Add 2 cups or about 1-inch white wine to a saucepan and add a splash of vinegar and big pinch salt. Add the bouquet garni to the saucepan and bring the mixture to a slow simmer. Once at a slow simmer, remove the bouquet garni. Carefully crack the egg into a ramekin. Gently slide the cracked egg into the liquid and poach. While the egg is cooking, baste or spoon some of the hot liquid over the egg to cook evenly, about 45 seconds to 1 minute. Remove the egg from the liquid with a slotted spoon and place into a small dish. Season the egg with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nFor serving: Place the toast slice onto a plate. Top with the salad and egg. Garnish with more bacon, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, extra-virgin olive oil. Drizzle with more dressing and garnish with fresh tarragon, if desired.\nFor the vinaigrette: Combine the shallot, garlic, salt, vinegar, mustard, and salt in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk in a few drops of the bacon fat and then begin adding the bacon fat in a thin stream, whisking continuously until all the oil is incorporated. Taste the dressing and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\nFor the pickled onions: Pack the onions in 2 (1-quart) jars and cover the water to come within 1/2-inch of the rim. Pour the water out into a measuring cup. Note the volume, pour off half of the water and replace it with vinegar. Add 2 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons salt for every 3 cups of liquid. Pour the vinegar mixture into a nonreactive saucepan, add the garlic, bay leaves, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, red pepper flakes, and mustard seeds, and bring to a boil over high heat.

    "instructions": "In a wide pan over medium-high heat, heat 1/3 cup of olive oil until quite hot. Add the tomatoes, red pepper flakes, and season lightly with the salt and pepper. (I always start with a light hand with the salt and pepper because as the tomatoes reduce, the salt will become concentrated.) Using a potato masher, mash the tomatoes finely. (This will be easier to do as the tomatoes begin to heat up.) Cook the tomatoes for 20 to 25 minutes, until the tomatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened.\nMeanwhile, stack and roll the basil leaves into a cylinder and cut thinly crosswise into a chiffonade.\nBring a large pot of amply salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti until just shy of al dente. Reserve a little of the pasta cooking water. Add the pasta to the sauce and cook over medium-high heat, gently tossing the pasta and the sauce together with a couple of wooden spoons and a lot of exaggerated movement (you can even shake the pan) until the pasta is just tender and the sauce, if any oil had separated from it, now looks cohesive. (If the sauce seems too thick, add a little pasta cooking liquid to adjust it.) Take the pan off of the heat and toss the butter, basil and cheese with the pasta in the same manner (the pasta should take on an orange hue) and serve immediately.\nCook's Note: Here is a good tip for peeling and seeding tomatoes: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Have a large bowl of ice water nearby. Cut a small shallow X on the bottom of each tomato. Ease about 5 tomatoes into the pot and cook for about 15 seconds, and then promptly move them to the ice water. (Do this with the remaining tomatoes.) Pull off the skin with the tip of a paring knife. If the skin sticks, try a vegetable peeler using a gentle sawing motion. Cut the tomatoes in half and use your finger to flick out the seeds.",
